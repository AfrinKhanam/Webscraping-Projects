discussion of certain omissions</a>.
Please <a href="http://fabpedigree.com/james/mailme.htm">send me e-mail</a> if
you believe there's a major flaw in
my rankings (or an error in any of the biographies).
Obviously the relative ranks of, say Fibonacci and
Ramanujan, will never satisfy everyone since the reasons
for their "greatness" are different.
I'm sure I've overlooked great mathematicians
who obviously belong on this list.
Please <a href="http://fabpedigree.com/james/mailme.htm">e-mail</a> and tell me!

</p><p>Following are the top mathematicians in
chronological (birth-year) order.
(By the way, the ranking assigned to a mathematician will appear if you
place the cursor atop the name at the top of his mini-bio.):


<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><a name="Early"></a><font size="+0"><u><font color="#a00000">
<b>Earliest mathematicians</b></font></u></font>
</p><blockquote>
Little is known of the earliest mathematics, but the famous
<i>Ishango Bone</i> from Early Stone-Age Africa has tally marks suggesting
arithmetic.  The markings include six prime numbers (5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)
in order, though this is probably coincidence.

<p>The advanced artifacts of Egypt's Old Kingdom
and the Indus-Harrapa civilization
imply strong mathematical skill, but the first
written evidence of advanced arithmetic dates from Sumeria,
where 4500-year old clay tablets show multiplication and
division problems; the first abacus may be about this old.
By 3600 years ago, Mesopotamian tablets show
tables of squares, cubes, reciprocals, and even logarithms
and trig functions,
using a primitive place-value system (in base 60, not 10).
Babylonians were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem,
solutions to quadratic equations,
even cubic equations (though they didn't have a general solution for these),
and eventually even developed methods to estimate
terms for compound interest.
The Greeks borrowed from Babylonian mathematics, which was the most
advanced of any before the Greeks; but there is no
ancient Babylonian mathematician whose name is known.

</p><p>Also at least 3600 years ago, the Egyptian scribe Ahmes
produced a famous manuscript
(now called the <i>Rhind Papyrus</i>),
itself a copy of a late Middle Kingdom text.
It showed simple algebra methods and

expressions using Egyptian fractions.
(Today, Egyptian fractions lead to challenging number theory
problems with no practical applications, but they may have
had practical value for the Egyptians.
To divide 17 grain bushels among 21 workers, the
equation 17/21 = 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/7 has practical value,
especially when compared with
the "greedy" decomposition
17/21 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/17 + 1/1428.)

</p><p>The Pyramids demonstrate that Egyptians
were adept at geometry, though little written evidence survives.
Babylon was much more advanced than Egypt at arithmetic and algebra;
this was probably due, at least in part, to their place-value system.
But although their base-60 system survives (e.g. in the division
of hours and degrees into minutes and seconds) the Babylonian
notation, which used the equivalent of IIIIII XXXXXIIIIIII XXXXIII
to denote 417+43/60, was unwieldy compared to the
"ten digits of the Hindus."
(In 2016 historians were surprised to decode ancient Babylonian
texts and find very sophisticated astronomical calculations
of Jupiter's orbit.)

</p><p>The Egyptians used the approximation
<b>&#960; &#8776; (4/3)<sup>4</sup></b>
(derived from the idea that a
circle of diameter 9 has about the same area as a square of side 8).
Although the ancient Hindu mathematician Apastambha had achieved
a good approximation for <b>&#8730;2</b>, and the ancient Babylonians
an ever better <b>&#8730;2</b>, neither of these ancient
cultures achieved a <i>&#960;</i> approximation as good as Egypt's,
or better than <b>&#960; &#8776; 25/8</b>, until the Alexandrian era.

<p><a name="Thales" title="Ranked at � #100"><font size="+1"><u><font color="#a00000">
<b>Thales</b></font> of Miletus</u></font>
(ca 624 - 546 BC) Greek domain</a>
</p><blockquote>Thales was the Chief of the "Seven Sages" of ancient Greece,
and has been called the "Father of Science,"
the "Founder of Abstract Geometry,"
and the "First Philosopher."
Thales is believed to have studied mathematics
under Egyptians, who in turn were aware of much older
mathematics from Mesopotamia.
Thales may have invented the notion of compass-and-straightedge
construction.
Several fundamental theorems about triangles
are attributed to Thales, including the law of similar triangles
(which Thales used famously to calculate the height of the Great Pyramid)
and "Thales' Theorem" itself: the fact that any angle inscribed in
a semicircle is a right angle.
(The other "theorems" were probably more like well-known axioms,
but Thales proved Thales' Theorem using two of
his other theorems; it is said that Thales then sacrificed
an ox to celebrate what might have been the first
mathematical proof in Greece.)
Thales noted that, given a line segment
of length <i>x</i>, a segment of length <i>x/k</i> can be constructed
by first constructing a segment of length <i>kx</i>.

<p>Thales was also an astronomer; he invented the 365-day calendar,
introduced the use of Ursa Minor for finding North,
invented the gnomonic map projection (the first of many
methods known today to map (part of) the surface of a sphere
to a plane,
and is the first person believed to have correctly predicted a solar eclipse.
His theories of physics would seem quaint today, but he
seems to have been the first to describe magnetism and static electricity.
Aristotle said, "To Thales the primary question was
not what do we know, but how do we know it."
Thales was also a politician, ethicist, and military strategist.
It is said he once leased all available olive presses
after predicting a good olive season; he did this not
for the wealth itself, but as a demonstration of the use
of intelligence in business.
Thales' writings have not survived and are known only second-hand.
Since his famous theorems of geometry were probably already known
in ancient Babylon, his importance derives from imparting the
notions of mathematical proof and the scientific method
to ancient Greeks.
While more ancient mathematicians were concerned with practical
calculations, modern mathematics began with the Greek emphasis
on proofs and philosophy.  Pythagoras and Parmenides of Elea also
played key roles in that development which began with Thales.
These ideas led to the schools of Plato, Aristotle and Euclid,
and an intellectual blossoming unequaled until
Europe's Renaissance.
Thales is ranked #38 on the Pantheon List of Most
Popular and Productive Persons.

</p><p>Thales' student and successor was Anaximander, who is often called
the "First Scientist" instead of Thales: his theories were more
firmly based on experimentation and logic, while Thales still
relied on some animistic interpretations.
Anaximander is famous for astronomy, cartography and sundials,
and also enunciated a theory of evolution, that land species
somehow developed from primordial fish!
Anaximander's most famous student, in turn, was Pythagoras.

techniques, novel geometric construction techniques, a method of elementary
algebra, and what may be an early proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.
Apastambha's work uses the excellent (continued fraction)
approximation <b>&#8730;2
&#8776; 577/408</b>, a result probably derived with
a geometric argument.

<p>Apastambha built on the work of earlier Vedic scholars,
especially Baudhayana, as well
as Harappan and (probably) Mesopotamian mathematicians.
His notation and proofs were primitive, and there is little
certainty about his life.
However similar comments apply to Thales of Miletus, so it seems
fair to mention Apastambha (who was perhaps the
most creative Vedic mathematician before Panini)
along with Thales as one of the
earliest mathematicians whose name is known.

<b>Pythagoras</b></font> of Samos</u></font>
(ca 578-505 BC) Greek domain</a>
</p><blockquote>Pythagoras, who is sometimes called the "First Philosopher,"
studied under Anaximander, Egyptians, Babylonians,
and the mystic Pherekydes (from whom
Pythagoras acquired a belief in reincarnation); he became
the most influential of early Greek mathematicians.
He is credited with being first to use axioms
and deductive proofs, so his influence on Plato and Euclid may be enormous;
he is generally credited with much of
Books I and II of Euclid's <i>Elements</i>.
He and his students (the "Pythagoreans") were ascetic mystics
for whom mathematics was partly a spiritual tool.
(Some occultists treat Pythagoras as a wizard and founding mystic
philosopher.)
Pythagoras was very interested in astronomy and seems to have been the
first man to realize that the Earth was a globe similar to the other planets.
He and his followers began to study the question of planetary motions,
which would not be resolved for more than two millennia.
The words <i>philosophy</i> and <i>mathematics</i> are said to have
been coined by Pythagoras.
He is supposed to have invented the <i>Pythagorean Cup</i>, a clever
wine goblet which punishes a drinker who greedily fills his cup to the top
by then using siphon pressure to drain the cup.

<p>Pythagoras ranks #10 on the Pantheon Popularity/Productivity List, but despite this historical importance I may have ranked him too high:
many results of the Pythagoreans were
due to his students; none of their writings survive; and what
is known is reported second-hand, and possibly
exaggerated, by Plato and others.
Some ideas attributed to him were probably first enunciated by successors
like Parmenides of Elea (ca 515-440 BC).
Archaeologists now believe that he was not first to invent the diatonic
scale: <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/the-oldest-song-in-the-world.html">
Here is a diatonic-scale song from Ugarit</a>
which predates Pythagoras by eight centuries.
</p><p>Pythagoras' students included Hippasus of Metapontum,
the famous anatomist and physician Alcmaeon (who
was first to claim that thinking occurred in the brain rather than heart),
Milo of Croton,
and Milo's daughter Theano (who may have been Pythagoras's wife).
The term <i>Pythagorean</i> was also adopted by many disciples who lived later;
these disciples include Philolaus of Croton,
the natural philosopher Empedocles, and several other famous Greeks.
Pythagoras' successor was apparently Theano herself:
the Pythagoreans were one of the few ancient schools
to practice gender equality.

</p><p>Pythagoras discovered that harmonious intervals in music are based on
simple rational numbers.
This led to a fascination with integers
and mystic numerology;
he is sometimes called the "Father of Numbers"
and once said "Number rules the universe."
(About the mathematical basis of music, Leibniz later wrote,
"Music is the pleasure the human soul experiences from counting
without being aware that it is counting."
Other mathematicians who investigated the arithmetic
of music included Huygens, Euler and Simon Stevin.)
Given any numbers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> the Pythagoreans were aware
of the three distinct means:
<b>(a+b)/2</b> (arithmetic mean),
<b>&#8730;(ab)</b> (geometric mean), and
<b>2ab/(a+b)</b> (harmonic mean).

</p><p>The Pythagorean Theorem was known long before Pythagoras,
but he was often credited (before discovery of an ancient Chinese text)
with the first <i>proof</i>.
He may have discovered the simple parametric form
of primitive Pythagorean triplets <b>(xx-yy, 2xy, xx+yy)</b>,
although the first explicit mention of this may be in Euclid's <i>Elements</i>.
Other discoveries of the Pythagorean school include the
construction of the regular pentagon,
concepts of perfect and amicable numbers,
polygonal numbers,
golden ratio (attributed to Theano),
three of the five regular solids (attributed to Pythagoras himself),
and irrational numbers (attributed to Hippasus).
It is said that the discovery
of irrational numbers upset the Pythagoreans so much
they tossed Hippasus into the ocean!
(Another version has Hippasus banished for revealing
the secret for constructing the sphere which circumscribes
a dodecahedron.)

</p><p>In addition to Parmenides, the famous successors of Thales and Pythagoras
include Zeno of Elea (see below),
Hippocrates of Chios (see below),
Plato of Athens (ca 428-348 BC),
Theaetetus (see below), and Archytas (see below).
These early Greeks ushered in a Golden Age of Mathematics
and Philosophy
unequaled in Europe until the Renaissance.
The emphasis was on pure, rather than practical, mathematics.
Plato (who ranks #40 on Michael Hart's famous list of
the Most Influential Persons in History)
decreed that his scholars should do
geometric construction solely with compass and straight-edge
rather than with "carpenter's tools" like
rulers and protractors.

of the Sanskrit language, especially in his text <i>Ashtadhyayi</i>.
Although this work might be considered the very first study
of linguistics or grammar, it used a non-obvious elegance
that would not be equaled in the West until the 20th century.
Linguistics may seem an unlikely qualification for a "great mathematician,"
but language theory is a field of mathematics.
The works of eminent 20th-century linguists and computer scientists
like Chomsky, Backus, Post and Church
are seen to resemble Panini's work 25 centuries earlier.
Panini's systematic study of Sanskrit may have inspired
the development of Indian science and algebra.
Panini has been called "the Indian Euclid" since the rigor
of his grammar is comparable to Euclid's geometry.

<p>Although his great texts have been preserved, little else
is known about Panini.  Some scholars would place his dates a century
later than shown here; he may or may not have been the same person
as the famous poet Panini.
In any case, he was the very last Vedic Sanskrit scholar by
definition: his text formed the transition to the
Classic Sanskrit period.
Panini has been called "one of the most innovative
people in the whole development of knowledge;"
his grammar "one of the greatest monuments of human intelligence."

ancient Greece.
This fame, which continues to the present-day, is largely due to
his paradoxes of infinitesimals, e.g. his argument
that Achilles can never catch the tortoise (whenever Achilles arrives
at the tortoise's last position, the tortoise has moved on).
Although some regard these paradoxes as simple fallacies,
they have been contemplated for many centuries.
It is due to these paradoxes that
the use of infinitesimals, which provides the basis for mathematical analysis,
has been regarded as a non-rigorous heuristic and
is finally viewed as sound only after the work of the great
19th-century rigorists, Dedekind and Weierstrass.
Zeno's Arrow Paradox (at any single instant an arrow is at a fixed
position, so where does its motion come from?) has lent its name to
the Quantum Zeno Effect, a paradox of quantum physics.

have invented the <i>reductio ad absurdem</i> proof method.
Hippocrates is most famous for his work on the three ancient
geometric quandaries: his work on cube-doubling
(the <i>Delian Problem</i>) laid the groundwork
for successful efforts by Archytas and others;
and some claim Hippocrates was first to trisect the general angle.
His circle quadrature was of course ultimately unsuccessful but
he did prove ingenious theorems about "lunes" (crescent-shaped
circle fragments).
For example, the area of any right triangle is equal to the
sum of the areas of the two lunes formed when semi-circles
are drawn on each of the three edges of the triangle.
Hippocrates also did work in algebra and rudimentary analysis.

</p><blockquote>Archytas was an important statesman as well
as philosopher.  He studied under Philolaus of Croton,
was a friend of Plato, and tutored Eudoxus.
In addition to discoveries always attributed to him,
he may be the source of several of Euclid's theorems,
and some works attributed to Eudoxus and perhaps Pythagoras.
Recently it has been shown that the magnificent <i>Mechanical Problems</i>
attributed to (pseudo-)Aristotle were probably actually written
by Archytas, making him one of the greatest mathematicians
of antiquity.
<p>Archytas introduced "motion" to geometry, rotating curves to
produce solids.
If his writings had survived he'd surely be considered one
of the most brilliant and innovative geometers of antiquity.
He appears on Cardano's List of 12 Greatest Geniuses.
(Euclid, Aristotle, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy,
and the physician Galen of Pergamum
are the other Greeks on that List.)
Archytas' most famous mathematical achievement was
"doubling the cube" (constructing a line segment larger than
another by the factor cube-root of two).
Although others solved the problem with
other techniques, Archytas' solution for cube doubling was astounding because
it wasn't achieved in the plane, but involved the intersection
of three-dimensional bodies.
This construction (which introduced the <i>Archytas Curve</i>)
has been called "a tour de force of the spatial imagination."
He invented the term <i>harmonic mean</i> and worked with geometric means
as well (proving that consecutive integers never have rational geometric mean).
He was a true polymath: he advanced the theory of music far beyond Pythagoras;
studied sound, optics and cosmology;
invented the pulley (and a rattle to occupy infants); wrote about
the lever; developed the curriculum called quadrivium;
is credited with inventing the screw;
and is supposed to have built a steam-powered wooden bird which
flew for 200 meters.
Archytas is sometimes called the "Father of Mathematical Mechanics."

</p><blockquote>Eudoxus journeyed widely for his education,
despite that he was not wealthy,
studying mathematics with Archytas in Tarentum,
medicine with Philiston in Sicily,
philosophy with Plato in Athens,
continuing his mathematics study in Egypt,
touring the Eastern Mediterranean with his own students
and finally returned to Cnidus where he established himself
as astronomer, physician, and ethicist.
What is known of him is second-hand, through the writings
of Euclid and others, but he was one
of the most creative mathematicians of the ancient world.

<p>Many of the theorems
in Euclid's <i>Elements</i> were first proved by Eudoxus.
While Pythagoras had been horrified by the discovery of irrational
numbers, Eudoxus is famous for incorporating them into arithmetic.
He also developed the earliest techniques of the infinitesimal calculus;
Archimedes credits Eudoxus with inventing a principle eventually called
the <i>Axiom of Archimedes</i>:
it avoids Zeno's paradoxes by, in effect, forbidding
infinities and infinitesimals.
Eudoxus' work with irrational numbers, infinitesimals and limits
eventually inspired masters like Dedekind.
Eudoxus also introduced an <i>Axiom of Continuity</i>;
he was a pioneer in solid geometry;
and he developed his own solution to the Delian cube-doubling problem.
Eudoxus was the first great mathematical astronomer;
he developed the complicated ancient theory of planetary orbits;
and may have invented the astrolabe.
He may have invented the 365.25-day calendar based on leap
years, though it remained for Julius Caesar to popularize it.
(It is sometimes said that he knew that
the Earth rotates around the Sun, but that appears to be false;
it is instead Aristarchus of Samos, as cited by Archimedes, who
is often called the first "heliocentrist.")
One of Eudoxus' students was Menaechmus, who was first to
describe the conic sections and used them to devise a non-Platonic
solution to the cube-doubling problem (and perhaps the
circle-squaring problem as well).

</p><p>Four of Eudoxus' most famous discoveries were the volume
of a cone, extension of arithmetic to the irrationals, summing
formula for geometric series, and
viewing <b><i>&#960;</i></b> as the limit of polygonal perimeters.
None of these seems difficult today, but it does seem remarkable
that they were all first achieved by the same man.
Eudoxus has been quoted as saying
"Willingly would I burn to death like Phaeton, were this
the price for reaching the sun and learning its shape,
its size and its substance."

His science was a standard curriculum for almost 2000 years.
Although the physical sciences couldn't advance until the
discoveries by great men like Newton and Lavoisier,
Aristotle's work in the biological sciences
was superb, and served as paradigm until modern times.
Aristotle was personal tutor to the young Alexander the Great.
Aristotle's disciple and successor Theophrastus was also a
great scientist, as was Theophrastus' successor Strato of
Lampsacus.
<p>Although Aristotle was probably the greatest biologist of the ancient world,
his work in physics and mathematics may not seem enough
to qualify for this list.
But his teachings covered a very wide gamut and dominated
the development of ancient science.
His writings on definitions, axioms and proofs may have influenced Euclid;
and he was one of the first mathematicians to write on the subject of infinity.
His writings include geometric theorems, some with proofs
different from Euclid's or missing from Euclid altogether; one of these
(which is seen only in Aristotle's work prior to Apollonius)
is that a circle is the locus of points whose distances
from two given points are in constant ratio.
</p><p>A charge sometimes made against Aristotle is that his wrong
ideas held back the development of science.
But this charge is unfair; Aristotle himself stressed the importance
of observation and experimentation, and to be ready to reject
old hypotheses and prepare new ones.
Of course many of his ideas turned out to be wrong, but many were correct:
e.g. the explanation that sound comes from the vibration of air.
And even if, as is widely agreed, Aristotle's geometric theorems

</p><blockquote>
Euclid of Alexandria (not to be confused with Socrates' student,
Euclid of Megara, who lived a century earlier),
directed the school of mathematics at the great
university of Alexandria.  Little else is known for certain about his life,
but several very important mathematical achievements are credited to him.
He was the first to prove that there are infinitely
many prime numbers; he produced an incomplete proof of
the Unique Factorization Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic);
and he devised <i>Euclid's algorithm</i> for computing gcd.
He introduced the Mersenne primes
and observed that <b>(M<sup>2</sup>+M)/2</b>
is always perfect (in the sense of Pythagoras) if <b>M</b> is Mersenne.
(The converse, that any even perfect number has such a corresponding
Mersenne prime, was tackled by Alhazen and proven by Euler.)
His books contain many famous theorems, though much of the <i>Elements</i>
was due to predecessors like Pythagoras (most of Books I and II),
Hippocrates (Book III), Theodorus, Eudoxus (Book V),
Archytas (perhaps Book VIII) and Theaetetus.
Book I starts with an elegant proof that rigid-compass constructions
can be implemented with a collapsing compass.
(Given A, B, C, find CF = AB by first
constructing equilateral triangle ACD;
then use the compass to find E on AD with AE = AB;
and finally find F on DC with DF = DE.)
Book III Proposition 35 proves that when chords of a circle
intersect, the products of their segments are equal.
Although notions of trigonometry were not in use, Euclid's theorems
include some closely related to the Laws of Sines and Cosines.
Among several books attributed to Euclid are
<i>The Division of the
Scale</i> (a mathematical discussion of music), <i>The Optics</i>,
<i>The Cartoptrics</i> (a treatise on the theory of mirrors),
a book on spherical geometry, a book on logic fallacies,
and his comprehensive math textbook <i>The Elements</i>.
Several of his masterpieces have been lost, including
works on conic sections and other advanced geometric topics.
Apparently Desargues' Homology Theorem (a pair of triangles
is coaxial if and only if it is copolar) was proved in one
of these lost works; this is the fundamental theorem
which initiated the study of projective geometry.
Euclid ranks #14 on Michael Hart's famous list of
the Most Influential Persons in History.

<i>The Elements</i> introduced the notions of axiom and theorem;
was used as a textbook for 2000 years; and in fact is still the basis
for high school geometry, making
Euclid the leading mathematics teacher of all time.
Some think his best inspiration was recognizing that the
Parallel Postulate must be an axiom rather than a theorem.

<p>There are many famous quotations about Euclid and his books.
Abraham Lincoln abandoned his law studies when he didn't
know what "demonstrate" meant and "went home to my father's house
[to read Euclid], and stayed there till I could give any proposition
in the six books of Euclid at sight.
I then found out what demonstrate means, and went back to my law studies."

<b>Archimedes</b></font> of Syracuse</u></font>
(287-212 BC) Greek domain</a>
</p><blockquote>Archimedes is universally acknowledged to be
the greatest of ancient mathematicians.
He studied at Euclid's school (probably after
Euclid's death), but his work far surpassed, and even leapfrogged,
the works of Euclid.
(For example, some of Euclid's more difficult theorems are easy
analytic consequences of Archimedes' Lemma of Centroids.)
His achievements are particularly impressive given the
lack of good mathematical notation in his day.
His proofs are noted not only for brilliance but for
unequaled clarity, with a modern biographer (Heath) describing
Archimedes' treatises as "without exception monuments of mathematical
exposition ... so impressive in their perfection as to create a
feeling akin to awe in the mind of the reader."
Archimedes made advances in number theory, algebra, and analysis,
but is most renowned for his many theorems
of plane and solid geometry.
He might have been first to prove Heron's formula for
the area of a triangle.
His excellent approximation to <b>&#8730;3</b> indicates that
he'd partially anticipated the method of continued fractions.
He developed a recursive method of representing large
integers, and was first to note the law of exponents,
<b>10<sup>a</sup>�10<sup>b</sup> = 10<sup>a+b</sup></b>.
Working with exponents, he developed simple notation and names
for numbers larger than 10^(10^16); this will seem more startling
when you recall that it was another 18 centuries before Europeans
would invent the word "million."
<p>Archimedes found a method to trisect an arbitrary angle (using
a <i>markable</i> straightedge � the construction is impossible
using strictly Platonic rules).
One of his most remarkable and famous geometric results
was determining the area of a parabolic section, for which
he offered two independent proofs, one
using his <i>Principle of the Lever</i>,
the other using a geometric series.
Some of Archimedes' work survives only because Thabit ibn Qurra
translated the otherwise-lost <i>Book of Lemmas</i>; it contains
the angle-trisection method and several ingenious theorems
about inscribed circles.
(Thabit shows how to construct a regular heptagon; it may not be
clear whether this came from Archimedes, or was fashioned by Thabit
by studying Archimedes' angle-trisection method.)
Other discoveries known only second-hand include
the <i>Archimedean semiregular solids</i> reported by Pappus,
and the Broken-Chord Theorem reported by Alberuni.

</p><p>Archimedes and Newton might be the two best geometers ever, but
although each produced ingenious geometric proofs, often they used
non-rigorous calculus to <i>discover</i> results, and then devised
rigorous geometric proofs for publication.
Archimedes used integral calculus
to determine the centers of mass of hemisphere and cylindrical
wedge, and the volume of two cylinders' intersection.
He also worked with various spirals, paraboloids of revolution, etc.
Although Archimedes didn't develop differentiation (integration's inverse),
Michel Chasles credits him (along with Kepler, Cavalieri, and Fermat,
who all lived more than 18 centuries later)
as one of the four who developed calculus before Newton and Leibniz.
(Although familiar with the utility of infinitesimals, he
accepted the "Theorem of Eudoxus" which bans them to avoid
Zeno's paradoxes.  Modern mathematicians refer to that "Theorem" as
the Axiom of Archimedes.)

</p><p>Archimedes was an astronomer (details of his discoveries are lost,
but it is likely he knew the Earth rotated around the Sun).
He was one of the greatest mechanists ever, discovering
Archimedes' Principle of Hydrostatics.
(A body partially or completely
immersed in a fluid effectively loses weight equal to the
weight of the fluid it displaces.  Archimedes is famous for testing
the purity of his King's gold crown, but he didn't write up
his solution; it was finally Galileo who pointed
out that a test based on measuring water displacement, as had
been assumed to be Archimedes' "Eureka!" method, would be
extremely imprecise.  Instead Archimedes must have
applied the less trivial corollaries of his Principle of Hydrostatics
by comparing a balance scale's reading in and out of water.)
Archimedes developed the mathematical foundations underlying the
advantage of basic machines: lever, screw and compound pulley.
Although Archytas perhaps invented the screw,
and Stone-Age man (and even other animals) used levers,
it is said that the compound
pulley was invented by Archimedes himself.
For these achievements he is widely considered to be one
of the three or four greatest theoretical physicists ever.
Archimedes was a prolific inventor:
in addition to inventing the compound pulley, he
invented the hydraulic screw-pump (called Archimedes' screw);
a miniature planetarium; and several
war machines -- catapult, parabolic mirrors to burn enemy ships,
a steam cannon, and 'the Claw of Archimedes.'
(Some scholars attribute the <i>Antikythera mechanism</i>
to Archimedes -- Is it the Archimedean planetarium mentioned by Cicero?
However this is unlikely: the detailed motion of the Moon produced
by the mechanism was probably unknown until Hipparchus.)
</p><p>His books include
<i>Floating Bodies</i>,
<i>Spirals</i>,
<i>The Sand Reckoner</i>,
<i>Measurement of the Circle</i>,
<i>Sphere and Cylinder</i>, 
<i>Plane Equilibriums</i>,
<i>Conoids and Spheroids</i>,
<i>Quadrature of Parabola</i>,
<i>The Book of Lemmas</i> (translated and attributed by Thabit ibn Qurra),
various now-lost works (on Mirrors, Balances and Levers, Semi-regular Polyhedra,
etc.) cited by Pappus or others,
and (discovered only recently,
and often called his most important work) <i>The Method</i>.
He developed the <i>Stomachion</i> puzzle (and solved a difficult
enumeration problem involving it); other famous gems
include <i>The Cattle-Problem</i>.
<i>The Book of Lemmas</i> contains various geometric gems
("the Salinon," "the Shoemaker's Knife", etc.) and is credited
to Archimedes by Thabit ibn Qurra but the attribution is disputed.

</p><p>Archimedes discovered formulae for the volume and surface area
of a sphere, and may even have been first to notice and prove the
simple relationship between a circle's circumference and area.
For these reasons,
<b>&#960;</b> is often called <i>Archimedes' constant</i>.
His approximation <b>223/71 &lt; &#960; &lt; 22/7</b>
was the best of his day.
(Apollonius soon surpassed it, but by using Archimedes' method.)
Archimedes' Equiarea Map Theorem asserts that a sphere and its enclosing
cylinder have equal surface area (as do the figures' truncations).
Archimedes also proved that the volume of that sphere is two-thirds the volume
of the cylinder.
He requested that a representation of such a sphere and
cylinder be inscribed on his tomb.

</p><p>That Archimedes shared the attitude of later mathematicians like
Hardy and Brouwer is suggested by Plutarch's comment that Archimedes regarded
applied mathematics "as ignoble and sordid ... and did not deign
to [write about his mechanical inventions; instead]
he placed his whole ambition in those speculations the beauty and subtlety of
which are untainted by any admixture of the common needs of life."

</p><p>Some of Archimedes' greatest writings (including
<i>The Method</i> and <i>Floating Bodies</i>) are preserved only on a
palimpsest rediscovered in 1906 and mostly deciphered only after 1998.
Ideas unique to that work are an anticipation of Riemann
integration, calculating
the volume of a cylindrical wedge (previously first attributed to Kepler).
Along with Oresme and Galileo, Archimedes was among the few to comment
on the "equinumerosity paradox" (the fact that there are as many perfect
squares as integers).
Although Euler and Newton
may have been the most important mathematicians,
and Gauss, Weierstrass and Riemann the greatest theorem provers,
it is widely accepted that
Archimedes was the greatest genius who ever lived.
Yet, Hart omits him altogether from his list of Most Influential Persons:
Archimedes was simply <i>too</i> far ahead of his time to have great historical
significance.
(He does rank #11 on the Pantheon List.
Some think the Scientific Revolution would have begun sooner
had <i>The Method</i> been discovered four or five centuries earlier.

<p><a name="Apollo" title="Ranked at � #31"><font size="+1"><u><font color="#a00000">
<b>Apollonius</b></font> of Perga</u></font>
(262-190 BC) Greek domain</a>
</p><blockquote>
Apollonius Pergaeus, called "The Great Geometer,"
is sometimes considered the second greatest
of ancient Greek mathematicians. (Euclid, Eudoxus and Archytas
are other candidates for this honor.)
His writings on conic sections have been studied until
modern times;
he developed methods for normals and curvature.
(He is often credited with inventing the names for parabola,
hyperbola and ellipse; but these shapes were previously described
by Menaechmus, and their names may also predate Apollonius.)
Although astronomers eventually concluded it was not physically correct,
Apollonius developed the "epicycle and deferent" model of planetary orbits,
and proved important theorems in this area.
He deliberately emphasized the beauty of pure, rather than
applied, mathematics, saying his theorems were
"worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves."
The following
generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem, where M is the midpoint of BC,
is called Apollonius' Theorem:
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<b>AB<sup> 2</sup> + AC<sup> 2</sup> =
2(AM<sup> 2</sup> + BM<sup> 2</sup>)</b>.

<p>Many of his works have survived only in a fragmentary form,
and the proofs were completely lost.
Most famous was the <i>Problem of Apollonius</i>,
which is to find a circle tangent to three objects, with the 
objects being points, lines, or circles, in any combination.
Constructing the eight circles each tangent to three other circles
is especially challenging, but just finding the two circles
containing two given points and tangent to a given line is
a serious challenge.
Vieta was renowned for discovering methods for all ten
cases of this Problem.
Other great mathematicians who have enjoyed reconstructing
Apollonius' lost theorems
include Fermat, Pascal, Newton, Euler, Poncelet and Gauss.

</p><p>In evaluating the genius of the ancient Greeks,
it is well to remember that their achievements were made
without the convenience of modern notation.
It is clear from his writing that Apollonius almost developed
the analytic geometry of Descartes, but
failed due to the lack of such elementary concepts as negative numbers.
Leibniz wrote "He who understands Archimedes and Apollonius will admire less
the achievements of the foremost men of later times."

<b>Chang Tshang</b></font> </u></font>
(ca 200-142 BC) China</a>
</p><blockquote>Chinese mathematicians excelled for thousands of years,
and were first to discover various algebraic and geometric principles.
There is some evidence that Chinese writings influenced India and
the Islamic Empire, and thus, indirectly, Europe.
Although there were great Chinese mathematicians a thousand years before
the Han Dynasty (as evidenced by the ancient <i>Zhoubi Suanjing</i>),
and innovations continued for centuries after Han,
the textbook <i>Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</i>
has special importance.
<i>Nine Chapters</i> (known in Chinese as <i>Jiu Zhang Suan Shu</i>
or <i>Chiu Chang Suan Shu</i>)
was apparently written during the early Han Dynasty (about 165 BC)
by Chang Tshang (also spelled Zhang Cang).

<p>Many of the mathematical concepts of the early Greeks were
discovered independently in early China.
Chang's book gives methods of arithmetic (including cube roots)
and algebra,
uses the decimal system (though zero was represented as just a space,
rather than a discrete symbol),
proves the Pythagorean Theorem,
and includes a clever geometric proof that the perimeter of
a right triangle times the radius of its inscribing
circle equals the area of its circumscribing rectangle.
(Some of this may have been added after the time of Chang;
some additions attributed to Liu Hui are mentioned in his mini-bio;
other famous contributors are Jing Fang and Zhang Heng.)

</p><p><i>Nine Chapters</i> was probably based on earlier books,
lost during the great book burning of 212 BC, and
Chang himself may have been a lord who commissioned others to
prepare the book.
Moreover, important revisions and commentaries were added
after Chang, notably by Liu Hui (ca 220-280).
Although Liu Hui mentions Chang's skill, it isn't clear
Chang had the mathematical genius to qualify for this list,
but he would still be a strong candidate due to his book's
immense historical importance:
It was the dominant Chinese mathematical text for centuries,
and had great influence throughout the Far East.
After Chang,
Chinese mathematics continued to flourish, discovering
trigonometry, matrix methods, the Binomial Theorem, etc.
Some of the teachings made their way to India,
and from there to the Islamic world and Europe.
There is some evidence that the Hindus borrowed the
decimal system itself from books like <i>Nine Chapters</i>.

</p><p>No one person can be credited with the invention of
the decimal system, but key roles were played by early Chinese
(Chang Tshang and Liu Hui),
Brahmagupta (and earlier Hindus including Aryabhata),
and Leonardo Fibonacci.
(After Fibonacci, Europe still did not embrace the decimal system
until the works of Vieta, Stevin, and Napier.)

<b>Hipparchus</b></font> of Nicaea and Rhodes</u></font>
(ca 190-127 BC) Greek domain</a>
</p><blockquote>Ptolemy may be the most famous astronomer
before Copernicus, but he borrowed heavily from Hipparchus,
who should thus be considered (along with Galileo and Edwin Hubble)
to be one of the three greatest astronomers ever.
Careful study of the <i>errors</i> in the catalogs
of Ptolemy and Hipparchus reveal both that Ptolemy
borrowed his data from Hipparchus, and that Hipparchus
used principles of spherical trig to simplify his work.
Classical Hindu astronomers, including the 6th-century genius
Aryabhata, borrow much from Ptolemy and Hipparchus.
Most of Hipparchus' work has been lost, and little is known of
his life.  Even his dates have been deduced from the lunar
eclipses he discusses.  (Some of his delicate measurements
required lunar eclipses.)
<p>Hipparchus is called the "Father of Trigonometry"; he
developed spherical trigonometry,
produced trig tables, and more.
He produced at least fourteen texts of physics and mathematics
nearly all of which have been lost, but which seem to
have had great teachings, including
much of Newton's Laws of Motion.
In one obscure surviving work he demonstrates familiarity
with the combinatorial enumeration method now called Schr�der's Numbers.
He invented the circle-conformal stereographic
and orthographic map projections which carry his name.
As an astronomer, Hipparchus is credited with the discovery
of equinox precession, length of the year, thorough
star catalogs, and invention
of the armillary sphere and perhaps the astrolabe.
He had great historical influence in Europe, India and
Persia, at least if credited also with Ptolemy's influence.
(Hipparchus himself was influenced by Babylonian astronomers.)
Hipparchus' work implies a better approximation to <b>&#960;</b>
than that of Apollonius, perhaps it was <b>&#960; &#8776; 377/120</b> as
Ptolemy used.

</p><p>The <i>Antikythera mechanism</i> is an astronomical clock
considered amazing for its time.
It may have been built about the time of Hipparchus'
death, but lost after a few decades
(remaining at the bottom of the sea for 2000 years).
The mechanism implemented the complex orbits which Hipparchus had developed
to explain irregular planetary motions;
it's not unlikely the great genius helped design this intricate
analog computer, which may have been built in Rhodes
where Hipparchus spent his final decades.
(Recent studies suggest that the mechanism might have been
designed soon after Archimedes' time, but that genius
was probably not the designer: the Mechanism doesn't match descriptions
of the planetariums that Archimedes built.)

</p><p>(Let's mention another Greek astronomer contemporaneous to Hipparchus,
Seleucus of Seleucia (ca 190-145 BC), who is noted for supporting
heliocentrism. explaining tides, and proposing that the universe is infinite.)

He had a notion of evolution (though not species origin)

He wrote on mechanics (analysing the five basic machines of
mechanical advantage), astronomy (determining longitudes),
hydrostatics, architecture, surveying, optics (he introduced the
'shortest-distance' explanation for mirror reflection),
arithmetic (finding square roots and cube roots),
and geometry (finding the areas and volumes of various shapes).
He was an inventor; he was first to describe a syringe, a windmill,
a pump for extinguishing fires, and some very primitive counters and computers.
He is especially famous for his invention of the aeolipile which
rotated using
steam from an attached cauldron, and is considered the first steam engine.
(Vitruvius may have described such a machine before Heron.)
He is noted for designing various toys (probably developed as teaching
aids for his lectures); these included a puppet theater driven by strings
and weights, a robot trumpet, trick wine glasses, a windmill-driven organ,
and coin-operated vending machine.
His most famous discovery in mathematics was
Heron's Formula for the area A of a triangle with sides a,b,c:

<p>But there is some controversy about the actual authorship of Heron's books;

</p><blockquote>Ptolemy `the Wise,' Librarian of Alexandria,
was one of the most famous of ancient Greek scientists,
ranking #80 on the Pantheon List of Most Popular and Productive Persons.
His textbooks were among the most important of the ancient world,
perhaps because they supplanted most that had come before.
He provided new insights into optics and music;
he was the best geographer of his day.
Among his mathematical results, most famous may be Ptolemy's Theorem
(<b>AC�BD</b> = <b>AB�CD</b> + <b>BC�AD</b>
if and only if <b>ABCD</b> is a cyclic quadrilateral).
This theorem has many useful corollaries; it was frequently applied
in Copernicus' work.
Ptolemy wrote on trigonometry, optics, geography, and map projections;
but is most famous for his astronomy,
where he perfected the geocentric model of planetary motions.
For this work, Cardano included Ptolemy on his List of 12 Greatest Geniuses,
but removed him from the list after learning of Copernicus' discovery.
Interestingly, Ptolemy wrote that the fixed point in a model of planetary
motion was arbitrary, but rejected the Earth spinning on its axis
since he thought this would lead to powerful winds.
Ptolemy discussed and tabulated the 'equation of time,' documenting the
irregular apparent motion of the Sun.  (It took fifteen centuries
before this irregularity was correctly attributed to Earth's elliptical orbit.)

<p><a name="Geocent"></a><font size="+0"><u><font color="#a00000">
<b>Geocentrism vs. Heliocentrism</b></font></u></font>
</p><blockquote>The mystery of celestial motions directed scientific inquiry
for thousands of years.
Except for some Pythagoreans like Philolaus of Croton,
thinkers generally assumed that the Earth was the center of the universe,
but this made it very difficult to explain the orbits of the other planets.
This problem had been considered by Eudoxus, Apollonius, and Hipparchus,
who developed a very complicated geocentric model involving
concentric spheres and epicycles.
Ptolemy perfected (or, rather, complicated) this model even further,
introducing 'equants' to further fine-tune the orbital speeds;
this model was the standard for 14 centuries.
While some Greeks, notably Aristarchus and Seleucus,
proposed heliocentric models,
these were usually rejected due to the lack of parallax among stars,
and the lack of the ferocious winds that might be expected if
the Earth were in motion.
(However some historians believe that many ancient Greek
scholars, perhaps including Plato, accepted the possibility of Earth's motion,
and that geocentrism became dogma only after Ptolemy's work.)
Aristarchus guessed that the stars were at an almost unimaginable
distance, explaining the lack of parallax.
Aristarchus would be almost unknown except that
Archimedes mentions, and assumes, Aristarchus' heliocentrism in
<i>The Sand Reckoner</i>.
I suspect that Archimedes accepted heliocentrism, but thought saying
so openly would distract from his work.
Several thinkers proposed a hybrid system with Mercury and Venus rotating
the Sun but the outer planets and the Sun itself rotating Earth; these
thinkers may have included ancient Egyptians, the Greek Heraclides of Pontus,
some of the Islamic scientists,
a member of Madhava's Kerala school, and Tycho Brahe -- the astronomer
who linked Copernicus to Kepler.
<p>A related question is: Does the Earth spin daily on its axis? All
heliocentrists, beginning with Heraclides of Pontus, seem to have accepted
that, as well as some who were more doubtful
about the Earth's annual orbit.
Another related question is: Is the universe finite, or is it infinite?
Democritus, Seleucus, Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno
were four who proposed an infinite universe prior to Galileo.
</p><p>Hipparchus was another ancient Greek who considered heliocentrism but,
because he never guessed
that orbits were ellipses rather than cascaded circles, was unable to come
up with a heliocentric model that fit his data.
Aryabhata, Alhazen, Alberuni, Omar Khayy�m, (perhaps some other
Islamic mathematicians like al-Tusi), Regiomontanus, and Leonardo
da Vinci are
other great pre-Copernican mathematicians who may have accepted
the possibility of heliocentrism. 
Another reason to doubt that the Earth moves, is that we don't
feel that motion, or see its effect on falling bodies.  This
difficulty, which almost disappears once Newton's First Law of Motion
is accepted, was addressed before Newton by Jean Buridan,
Nicole Oresme, Giordano Bruno,
Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655) and, of course, Galileo Galilei.
</p><p>The great skill demonstrated by Ptolemy and his predecessors in
developing their complex geocentric cosmology
may have <i>set back</i> science since in fact
the Earth rotates around the Sun.
The geocentric models couldn't
explain the observed changes in the brightness of Mars or Venus,
but it was the phases of Venus, discovered by Galileo after the invention
of the telescope, that finally led to general acceptance of heliocentrism. 
(Ptolemy's model predicted phases, but timed quite differently from
Galileo's observations.)

</p><p>Since the planets move without friction, their motions offer a pure
view of the Laws of Motion; this is one reason that the heliocentric
breakthroughs of Copernicus, Kepler and Newton triggered the advances
in mathematical physics which led to the Scientific Revolution.
<b>Heliocentrism offered an even more key understanding</b> that lead to
massive change in scientific thought.
For Ptolemy and other geocentrists, the "fixed" stars
were just lights on a sphere <i>rotating around the earth</i>, but after
the Copernican Revolution the fixed stars were understood to be
immensely far away; this made it possible to imagine that they were
themselves suns, perhaps with planets of their own.  (Nicole Oresme
and Nicholas of Cusa were pre-Copernican thinkers who wrote on both
the geocentric question and the possibility of other worlds.)
The Copernican perspective led
Giordano Bruno and Galileo to posit a single common set of 
physical laws which ruled both on Earth and in the Heavens.
(It was this, rather than just the happenstance of planetary orbits,
that eventually most outraged the Roman Church....
But we're getting way ahead of our story:
Copernicus, Bruno, Galileo and Kepler lived 14 centuries after Ptolemy.)

to Chang's influential textbook <i>Nine Chapters</i>,
making him among the most important of Chinese mathematicians ever.
(He seems to have been a much better mathematician
than Chang, but just as Newton might have gotten nowhere without Kepler,
Vieta, Huygens, Fermat, Wallis, Cavalieri, etc., so Liu Hui might
have achieved little had Chang not preserved the ancient
Chinese learnings.)
Among Liu's achievements
are an emphasis on generalizations and proofs,
incorporation of negative numbers into arithmetic,
an early recognition of the notions of infinitesimals and limits,
the Gaussian elimination method of solving
simultaneous linear equations,
calculations of solid volumes (including the use of Cavalieri's Principle),
anticipation of Horner's Method,
and a new method to calculate square roots.
Like Archimedes, Liu discovered the formula for a circle's area;
however he failed to calculate a sphere's volume, writing
"Let us leave this problem to whoever can tell the truth."

<p>Although it was almost child's-play for any of them,
Archimedes, Apollonius, and Hipparchus had all improved

<b>Diophantus</b></font> of Alexandria</u></font>
(ca 250) Greece, Egypt</a>
</p><blockquote>Diophantus was one of the most influential
mathematicians of antiquity; he wrote several books on
arithmetic and algebra,
and explored number theory further than anyone earlier.
He advanced a rudimentary arithmetic and algebraic notation, allowed
rational-number solutions to his problems rather than just integers,
and was aware of results like the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci Identity;
for these reasons he is often called the "Father of Algebra."
His work, however, may seem quite limited to a modern eye:
his methods were not generalized, he knew nothing
of negative numbers, and, though he often dealt with quadratic
equations, never seems to have commented on their second solution.
His notation, clumsy as it was, was used for many centuries.
(The shorthand <b>x<sup>3</sup></b>
for "x cubed" was not invented until Descartes.)

<p>Very little is known about Diophantus (he might even have come from
Babylonia, whose algebraic ideas he borrowed).
Many of his works have been lost, including proofs for lemmas
cited in the surviving work, some of which are so
difficult it would almost stagger the imagination to
believe Diophantus really had proofs.
Among these are Fermat's conjecture (Lagrange's theorem)
that every integer is the sum of four squares, and the
following:
"Given any positive rationals <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> with <b>a&gt;b</b>,
there exist positive rationals <b>c</b>, <b>d</b> such that
<b>a<sup>3</sup>-b<sup>3</sup> = c<sup>3</sup>+d<sup>3</sup></b>."
(This latter "lemma" was investigated by Vieta and Fermat and
finally solved, with some difficulty, in the 19th century.
It seems unlikely that Diophantus actually had proofs for such "lemmas.")

(ca 300) Egypt, Greece</a>
</p><blockquote>Pappus, along with Diophantus, may have been
one of the two greatest Western mathematicians
during the 13 centuries that separated Hipparchus and Fibonacci.
He wrote about arithmetic methods, plane and solid geometry,
the axiomatic method, celestial motions and mechanics.
In addition to his own original research, his texts are
noteworthy for preserving works of earlier mathematicians
that would otherwise have been lost.
<p>Pappus' best and most original result, and the one which gave
him most pride, may be the Pappus Centroid theorems
(fundamental, difficult and powerful theorems of solid geometry
later rediscovered by Paul Guldin).
His other ingenious geometric theorems
include Desargues' Homology Theorem (which Pappus attributes
to Euclid), an early form of Pascal's Hexagram Theorem,
called Pappus' Hexagon Theorem and related to a fundamental
theorem: Two projective pencils
can always be brought into a perspective position.
For these theorems, Pappus is sometimes called
the "Father of Projective Geometry."
Pappus also demonstrated how to perform angle trisection and
cube doubling if one can use mechanical curves like
a conchoid or hyperbola.
He stated (but didn't prove) the <i>Isoperimetric Theorem</i>, also
writing "Bees know this fact which is useful to them,
that the hexagon ... will hold more honey
for the same material than [a square or triangle]."
(That a honeycomb partition minimizes material for an equal-area
partitioning was finally proved in 1999 by Thomas Hales, who also
proved the related Kepler Conjecture.)
Pappus stated, but did not fully solve, the <i>Problem of Pappus</i>
which, given an arbitrary collection of lines in the plane, asks for
the locus of points whose distances to the lines have
a certain relationship.
This problem was a major inspiration for Descartes and was finally
fully solved by Newton.

</p><p>For preserving the teachings of Euclid and Apollonius,
as well as his own theorems of geometry, Pappus certainly
belongs on a list of great ancient mathematicians.
But these teachings lay dormant during Europe's Dark Ages, diminishing
Pappus' historical significance.

Alexander the Great spread Greek culture to Egypt and much of the Orient;
thus even Hindu mathematics may owe something to the Greeks.
Greece was eventually absorbed into the Roman Empire

Rome did not pursue pure science as Greece had (as we've seen,
the important mathematicians of the Roman era
were based in the Hellenic East)
and eventually Europe fell into a Dark Age.
The Greek emphasis on pure mathematics and proofs was

<b>Decimal system -- from India? China?? Persia???</b></font></u></font>
</p><blockquote>
Laplace called the decimal system "a profound and important idea
[given by India] which
appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit ... in
the first rank of useful inventions [but] it escaped the
genius of Archimedes and Apollonius."
But even after Fibonacci introduced the system to Europe, it was another
400 years before it came into common use.
<p>Ancient Greeks, by the way, did not use the
unwieldy Roman numerals, but rather used 27 symbols, denoting
1 to 9, 10 to 90, and 100 to 900.
Unlike our system, with ten digits separate from the alphabet,
the 27 Greek number symbols were the <i>same</i> as their
alphabet's letters; this might have hindered
the development of "syncopated" notation.
The most ancient Hindu records did not use the
ten digits of Aryabhata, but rather a system
similar to that of the ancient Greeks, suggesting that
China, and not India, may indeed be the "ultimate" source of the modern
decimal system.
</p><p>The Chinese used a form of decimal abacus as early as 3000 BC;
if it doesn't qualify, by itself, as a "decimal system" then
pictorial depictions of its numbers would.
Yet for thousands of years after its abacus, China had no zero symbol
other than plain space; and apparently didn't have one until after
the Hindus.  Ancient Persians and Mayans <i>did</i> have place-value
notation <i>with</i> zero symbols, but neither qualify as inventing
a base-10 decimal system: Persia used the base-60 Babylonian system;
Mayans used base-20. 
(Another difference is that the Hindus had nine distinct digit symbols
to go with their zero, while earlier place-value systems
built up from just two symbols: 1 and either 5 or 10.)
The Old Kingdom Egyptians did use a base-ten system, but it was
similar to that of Greece and Vedic India:
1, 10, 100 were depicted as separate symbols.
</p><p>Conclusion: The decimal place-value system with zero symbol seems
to be an obvious invention that in fact was very hard to invent.
If you insist on a single winner then India might be it.
But China, Babylonia, Persia and even the Mayans deserve Honorable Mention!

</p><blockquote>Indian mathematicians excelled for thousands of years,
and eventually even developed advanced techniques like Taylor series
before Europeans did, but they are
denied credit because of Western ascendancy.
Among the Hindu mathematicians, Aryabhata (called Arjehir by Arabs)
may be most famous.

<p>While Europe was in its early "Dark Age,"
Aryabhata advanced arithmetic, algebra,
elementary analysis, and especially
plane and spherical trigonometry, using the decimal system.
Aryabhata is sometimes called the "Father of Algebra"
instead of al-Khow�rizmi (who himself cites the work of Aryabhata).
His most famous accomplishment in mathematics
was the <i>Aryabhata Algorithm</i> (connected
to continued fractions) for solving Diophantine equations.
Aryabhata made several important discoveries in astronomy,
e.g. the nature of moonlight, and concept of sidereal year;
his estimate of the Earth's circumference was more accurate than
any achieved in ancient Greece.
He was among the very few ancient scholars who realized the Earth
rotated daily on an axis; claims that he also espoused heliocentric
orbits are controversial, but may be confirmed by the writings of al-Biruni.
Aryabhata is said to have introduced the constant <i>e</i>.
He used <b>&#960; &#8776; 3.1416</b>;
it is unclear whether he discovered this independently
or borrowed it from Liu Hui of China.
Although it was first discovered by Nicomachus three centuries earlier,
Aryabhata is famous for the identity
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>&#931; (k<sup>3</sup>) = (&#931; k)<sup>2</sup></b>
</p><p>Some of Aryabhata's achievements, e.g. an excellent approximation
to the sine function, are known only from the writings of
Bhaskara I, who wrote: "Aryabhata is
the master who, after reaching the furthest shores and plumbing the inmost
depths of the sea of ultimate knowledge of mathematics, kinematics
and spherics, handed over the three sciences to the learned world."

</p><blockquote>
<p>No one person gets unique credit for the invention of the
decimal system but Brahmagupta's textbook <i>Brahmasphutasiddhanta</i>
was very influential, and is sometimes considered
the first textbook "to treat zero as a number in its own right."
It also treated negative numbers.
(Others claim these were first seen 800 years earlier in
Chang Tshang's Chinese text and were implicit in
what survives of earlier Hindu works, but Brahmagupta's
text discussed them lucidly.)
Along with Diophantus, Brahmagupta was also among the first to express
equations with symbols rather than words.

</p><p>Brahmagupta Bhillamalacarya (`The Teacher from Bhillamala')
made great advances in arithmetic,
algebra, numeric analysis, and geometry.
Several theorems bear his name, including
the formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral:
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b>16 A<sup>2</sup> = (a+b+c-d)(a+b-c+d)(a-b+c+d)(-a+b+c+d)</b>
<br>Another famous Brahmagupta theorem dealing with
such quadrilaterals can be phrased
"In a circle, if the chords AB and CD are perpendicular
and intersect at E, then the line from E which bisects AC
will be perpendicular to BD."
He also began the study of rational quadrilaterals which Kummer would
eventually complete.
Proving Brahmagupta's theorems are good challenges even today.

</p><p>In addition to his famous writings on practical mathematics
and his ingenious theorems of geometry,
Brahmagupta solved the general quadratic equation,
and worked on number theory problems.
He was first to find a general solution to the simplest Diophantine
form.
His work on Pell's equations has been called "brilliant"
and "marvelous."
He proved the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci Identity
(the set of sums of two squares is closed under multiplication),
and generalized it further to assist in the Pell's solutions.
He applied mathematics to astronomy, predicting eclipses, etc.

otherwise have been lost; these include a famous
formula giving an excellent approximation to the
<i>sin</i> function, as well as, probably, the zero symbol itself.

As well as being an original thinker, Thabit was a key
translator of ancient Greek writings; he translated
Archimedes' otherwise-lost <i>Book of Lemmas</i> and applied
one of its methods to construct a regular heptagon.
He developed an important new cosmology superior
to Ptolemy's (and which, though it was not heliocentric,
may have inspired Copernicus).
He was perhaps the first great mathematician to take the
important step of emphasizing
real numbers rather than either rational numbers or geometric sizes.
He worked in plane and spherical trigonometry,
and with cubic equations.
He was an early practitioner of calculus and seems to
have been first to take the integral of <b>&#8730;x</b>.
Like Archimedes, he was
able to calculate the area of an ellipse,

made contributions to math, optics, and astronomy
which eventually influenced Roger Bacon, Regiomontanus, da Vinci, Copernicus,
Kepler, Galileo, Huygens, Descartes and Wallis,
thus affecting Europe's Scientific Revolution.
While Aristotle thought vision arose from rays sent from the eye
to the viewed object, and Ptolemy thought light rays originated
from objects, Alhazen understand that an object's light is
reflected sunlight.
He's been called the best scientist of the Middle Ages;
his <i>Book of Optics</i> has been called the most important
physics text prior to Newton;
his writings in physics anticipate the Principle of Least Action,
Newton's First Law of Motion, and the notion that white light
is composed of the color spectrum.
(Like Newton, he favored a particle theory of light over the
wave theory of Aristotle.)
His other achievements in optics include improved lens design,
an analysis of the camera obscura, Snell's Law,
an early explanation for the rainbow,
a correct deduction from refraction of atmospheric thickness,
and experiments on visual perception.
He studied optical illusions and was first to explain
psychologically why the Moon appears to be larger when near
the horizon.
He also did work in human anatomy and medicine.
(In a famous leap of over-confidence he claimed he could
control the Nile River; when the Caliph ordered him to do so,
he then had to feign madness!)
Alhazen has been called the "Father of Modern Optics,"
the "Founder of Experimental Psychology" (mainly for his work with
optical illusions), and,
because he emphasized hypotheses and experiments,
"The First Scientist."

<p>In number theory, Alhazen worked with perfect numbers, Mersenne primes,
and the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
He stated Wilson's Theorem (which is sometimes called Al-Haytham's Theorem).
Alhazen introduced the Power Series Theorem
(later attributed to Jacob Bernoulli).
His best mathematical work was with plane and solid geometry,
especially conic sections; he calculated the areas of lunes, volumes
of paraboloids, and constructed a regular heptagon using
intersecting parabolas.
He solved Alhazen's Billiard Problem (originally posed as a problem
in mirror design), a difficult construction which continued to intrigue
several great mathematicians including Huygens.
To solve it, Alhazen needed to
anticipate Descartes' analytic geometry,
anticipate B�zout's Theorem,
tackle quartic equations
and develop a rudimentary integral calculus.
Alhazen's attempts to prove the Parallel Postulate make him (along
with Thabit ibn Qurra) one of the earliest
mathematicians to investigate non-Euclidean geometry.

He was an early advocate of the Scientific Method.
He was also noted for his poetry.
He invented (but didn't build) a geared-astrolabe clock,

He wrote prodigiously on all scientific topics (his writings are estimated

his comprehensive encyclopedia about India, and <i>Shadows</i>,
which starts from notions about shadows but develops much astronomy
and mathematics.
He anticipated future advances
including Darwin's natural selection,
Newton's Second Law, the immutability of elements,
the nature of the Milky Way, and much modern geology.
Among several novel achievements in astronomy, he used
observations of lunar eclipse to deduce relative longitude,
estimated Earth's radius most accurately,
believed the Earth rotated on its
axis and may have accepted heliocentrism as a possibility.
In mathematics, he was first to apply the Law of Sines
to astronomy, geodesy, and cartography;
anticipated the notion of polar coordinates;
invented the azimuthal equidistant map projection in common use today,
as well as a polyconic method
now called the Nicolosi Globular Projection;
found trigonometric solutions to polynomial equations;
did geometric constructions including angle trisection;

but deserves mention as an advancing scientist, as does Avicenna's disciple
Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdada, who lived about a century later.)
<p>Al-Biruni has left us what seems to be the oldest surviving mention
of the Broken Chord Theorem (if M is the midpoint of circular arc ABMC,
and T the midpoint of "broken chord" ABC, then MT is perpendicular to BC).
Although he himself attributed the theorem to Archimedes,
Al-Biruni provided several novel proofs for, and useful corollaries of,
this famous geometric gem.
While Al-Biruni may lack the influence and mathematical brilliance to

<p><a name="Fibonacci" title="Ranked at � #29"><font size="+2"><u><font color="#a00000">
<b>Leonardo `Bigollo'</b></font> Pisano (Fibonacci)</u></font>
(ca 1170-1245) Italy</a>
</p><blockquote>Leonardo (known today as Fibonacci)
introduced the decimal system and other new methods of arithmetic to Europe,
and relayed the mathematics of the Hindus, Persians, and Arabs.
Others, especially Gherard of Cremona, had translated Islamic
mathematics, e.g. the works of al-Khow�rizmi, into Latin,
but Leonardo was the influential teacher.
(Two centuries earlier, the mathematician-Pope, Gerbert of Aurillac,
had tried unsuccessfully to introduce the decimal system to Europe.)
Leonardo also re-introduced older Greek ideas like
Mersenne numbers and Diophantine equations.
His writings cover a very broad range including
new theorems of geometry,
methods to construct and convert Egyptian fractions
(which were still in wide use),
irrational numbers,
the Chinese Remainder Theorem,
theorems about Pythagorean triplets,
and the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ....
which is now linked with the name Fibonacci.
In addition to his great historic importance and fame
(he was a favorite of Emperor Frederick II),
Leonardo `Fibonacci' is called "the greatest number theorist
between Diophantus and Fermat" and "the most <i>talented</i>
mathematician of the Middle Ages."

<p>Leonardo is most famous for his book <i>Liber Abaci</i>, but
his <i>Liber Quadratorum</i> provides the best demonstration of his skill.
He defined <i>congruums</i> and proved theorems about them,
including a theorem establishing the conditions for three square numbers
to be in consecutive arithmetic series; this has been called
the finest work in number theory prior to Fermat
(although a similar statement was made about one of Bhaskara II's theorems).
Although often overlooked, this work includes a proof
of the <i>n = 4</i> case of Fermat's Last Theorem.
(Leonardo's proof of FLT4 is widely ignored or considered incomplete.
<a href="http://fabpedigree.com/james/fibflt4.htm">I'm preparing a page to consider that question.</a>
Al-Farisi was another ancient mathematician who noted FLT4, although
attempting no proof.)
Another of Leonardo's noteworthy achievements was proving that
the roots of a certain cubic equation could not have any of the
constructible forms Euclid had outlined in Book 10 of his <i>Elements</i>.
He also wrote on, but didn't prove, Wilson's Theorem.

</p><p>Leonardo provided Europe with the decimal system,
algebra and the 'lattice' method of multiplication, all
far superior to the methods then in use.
He introduced notation like <b>3/5</b>; his clever extension
of this for quantities like <i>5 yards, 2 feet, and 3 inches</i>
is more efficient than today's notation.
It seems hard to believe but before the decimal
system, mathematicians had no notation for zero.
Referring to this system,
Gauss was later to exclaim "To what heights would science
now be raised if Archimedes had made that discovery!"

</p><p>Some histories describe him as bringing Islamic mathematics
to Europe, but in Fibonacci's own preface to <i>Liber Abaci</i>,
he specifically credits the Hindus:
</p><blockquote>
... as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art,
to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art
very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I
realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria,
Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods;
<br>
... But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art
of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect
to the method of the Hindus. Therefore,
embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and
taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain
things from my own understanding and inserting also certain
things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art, I have
striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably
as I could, ...
</blockquote>

<p>Had the Scientific Renaissance begun in the Islamic Empire,
someone like al-Khow�rizmi would have greater historic
significance than Fibonacci,
but the Renaissance did happen in Europe.
<i>Liber Abaci</i>'s summary of the
decimal system has been called "the most important sentence
ever written."
Even granting this to be an exaggeration, there is no doubt
that the Scientific Revolution owes a huge debt to
Leonardo `Fibonacci' Pisano.

in theology, ethics, logic, astronomy, and other fields of science.
He was a famous scholar and prolific writer,
describing evolution of species, stating that the Milky Way was
composed of stars,
and mentioning conservation of mass in his writings on chemistry.
He made a wide range of contributions to astronomy, and (along
with Omar Khayy�m) was one of the
most significant astronomers between Ptolemy and Copernicus.
He improved on the Ptolemaic model of planetary orbits, and even wrote
about (though rejecting) the possibility of heliocentrism.
(Allegedly one of his students hypothesized elliptical orbits.)
<p>Tusi is most famous for his mathematics.
He advanced algebra, arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, and even foundations,
working with real numbers and lengths of curves.
For his texts and theorems, he may be called the "Father of Trigonometry;"
he was first to properly state and prove several theorems
of planar and spherical trigonometry including the Law of Sines,
and the (spherical) Law of Tangents.
He wrote important
commentaries on works of earlier Greek and Islamic mathematicians;
he attempted to prove Euclid's Parallel Postulate.
Tusi's writings influenced European mathematicians including Wallis;
his revisions of the Ptolemaic model led him to the Tusi-couple,
a special case of trochoids usually called Copernicus' Theorem,
though historians have concluded Copernicus
discovered this theorem by reading Tusi.

</p><blockquote>Gersonides (aka Leo de Bagnols, aka RaLBaG) was a Jewish scholar of
great renown, preferring science and reason over religious orthodoxy.
He wrote important commentaries on Aristotle, Euclid, the Talmud,
and the Bible; he is most famous for his 
book <i>MilHamot Adonai</i> ("The Wars of the Lord") which
touches on many theological questions.
He was likely the most talented scientist of his time:
he invented the "Jacob's Staff" which became an important navigation
tool; described the principles of the camera obscura; etc.
In mathematics, Gersonides wrote texts on trigonometry,
calculation of cube roots, rules of arithmetic, etc.;
and gave rigorous derivations of rules of combinatorics.
He was first to make explicit use of mathematical induction.
At that time, "harmonic numbers" referred to integers with only 2 and
3 as prime factors; Gersonides solved a problem of music theory with
an ingenious proof that there were no consecutive harmonic numbers
larger than (8,9).
<small>(In fact, (2^3,3^2) is the only pair of consecutive powers;
this is Catalan's Conjecture and was first proved in the 21st century.)</small>
Levi ben Gerson published only in Hebrew so,
although some of his work was translated into
Latin during his lifetime, his influence was limited; much of his work was re-invented
three centuries later; and many histories of math overlook him altogether.
<p>Gersonides was also an outstanding astronomer.  He proved that
the fixed stars were at a huge distance, and found other
flaws in the Ptolemaic model.
But he specifically rejected heliocentrism, noteworthy since it

</p><blockquote>Oresme was of lowly birth but excelled at school,
became a young professor, and soon personal chaplain to King Charles V.
(One of his early teachers was Jean Buridan (ca 1300-ca 1358), famous
for positing what became Newton's First Law of Motion, contrary to
Aristotelian dogma.)
The King commissioned him to translate the works of
Aristotle into French (with Oresme thus playing key roles in
the development of both French science and French language), and
rewarded him by making him a Bishop.
His contributions to political science (on human rights and popular
monarchy) influenced King Charles V.
He wrote several books; was a renowned philosopher and natural scientist
(challenging several of Aristotle's ideas);
he contributed to economics (e.g. anticipating Gresham's Law)
and to optics (he was first to posit curved refraction).
Although the Earth's annual orbit around the Sun was left to Copernicus,
Oresme was among the pre-Copernican thinkers to claim clearly that the
Earth spun daily on its axis.

<p>In mathematics, Oresme observed that the integers were
equinumerous with the odd integers; was first to use fractional
(and even irrational) exponents;
introduced the symbol <b><i><big>+</big></i></b> for addition;
was first to write about general curvature;
and, most famously, first to prove the divergence of the harmonic series.
Oresme used a graphical diagram to demonstrate the Merton College Theorem
(a discovery related to Galileo's Law of Falling Bodies
made by Thomas Bradwardine, et al); it is said this was the
first abstract graph.
(Some believe that this effort inspired
Descartes' coordinate geometry and Galileo.)
Oresme was aware of Gersonides' work on harmonic numbers and was among
those who attempted to link music theory to the ratios of celestial
orbits, writing "the heavens are like a man who sings a melody and
at the same time dances, thus making music ... in song and in action."
Oresme's work was influential; with several discoveries ahead of

Madhava also did work with continued fractions, trigonometry,

</p><blockquote>Leonardo da Vinci is most renowned for his paintings --
<i>Mona Lisa</i>
and <i>The Last Supper</i> are among the most discussed
and admired paintings ever --
but he did much other work and was probably the most
talented, versatile and prolific polymath ever to live;
his writings exceed 13,000 folios.
He developed new techniques, and principles of perspective geometry,
for drawing, painting and sculpture;
he was also an expert architect and engineer;
and surely the most prolific inventor of all time.
Although most of his paper designs were never built, Leonardo's inventions
include reflecting and refracting telescope, adding machine,
parabolic compass,
improved anemometer, parachute, helicopter, flying ornithopter,
several war machines (multi-barreled gun, steam-driven cannon,
tank, giant crossbow, finned mortar shells, portable bridge),
pumps, an accurate spring-operated clock,
bobbin winder, robots, scuba gear, an elaborate musical
instrument he called the 'viola organista,' and more.
(Some of his designs, including the viola organista, his
parachute, and a large single-span bridge, were finally built five
centuries later; and worked as intended.)
Like another genius (Albert Einstein) da Vinci was intrigued
by the science of river meanders; there is a meandering river
in the background of <i>Mona Lisa</i>.
His scientific writings are much more extensive and thorough
than is generally appreciated; he made advances in anatomy, botany,
and many other fields of science;
he developed much mechanics including the theory of the arch;
he developed an octant-based map projection;
he was first to conceive of plate tectonics; and,
in one cryptic reference, shows belief in heliocentrism.
He was also a poet and musician.
<p>He had little formal training in mathematics until he was
in his mid-40's, when he and his friend Luca Pacioli
began tutoring each other.
(Pacioli, the other great Italian mathematician of that era,
was himself a polymath.  He was most famous for his very influential
textbook on double-entry accounting.)
Despite this slow start, he did make novel achievements in mathematics:
he was first to note the simple classification of symmetry
groups on the plane, achieved interesting bisections
and mensurations, advanced the craft of descriptive geometry,
and developed an approximate solution
to the circle-squaring problem.
He was first to discover the 60-vertex shape now called "buckyball."
(Leonardo is also widely credited with the elegant two-hexagon proof
of the Pythagorean Theorem, but this authorship
appears to be a myth.)
Along with Archimedes, Alberuni, Leibniz, and J. W. von Goethe,
Leonardo da Vinci was among the greatest geniuses ever;
but none of these appears on Hart's List

genius doesn't imply influence.
(However, M.I.T.'s Pantheon project ranks Leonardo da Vinci as

They derive their List with the statistics of

</p><blockquote>The European Renaissance developed in 15th-century
Italy, with the blossoming of great art, and
as scholars read books by great Islamic scientists like Alhazen.
The earliest of these great Italian polymaths were largely not noted
for mathematics, and Leonardo da Vinci began serious math study
only very late in life, so the best candidates for mathematical greatness
in the Italian Renaissance were foreigners.
Along with Regiomontanus from Bavaria, there was an even more famous
man from Poland.
<p>Nicolaus Copernicus (Mikolaj Kopernik) was a polymath:
he studied law and medicine;
published poetry; contemplated astronomy;
worked professionally as a church scholar and diplomat;
and was also a painter.
He studied Islamic works on astronomy and geometry
at the University of Bologna, and eventually wrote a book of great impact.
Although his only famous theorem of mathematics (that certain trochoids are
straight lines) may have been derived from Oresme's work,
or copied from Nasir al-Tusi,
it was mathematical thought that led Copernicus to the conclusion
that the Earth rotates around the Sun.
Despite opposition from the Roman church, this discovery
led, via Galileo, Kepler and Newton, to the Scientific Revolution.
For this revolution, Copernicus is ranked #19 on Hart's List
of the Most Influential Persons in History; however I think
there are several reasons why Copernicus' importance may be exaggerated:
(1) Copernicus' system still used circles and epicycles, so it
was left to Kepler to discover the facts of elliptical orbits;
(2) he retained the notion of a sphere of fixed stars,
thus missing the unifying insight that our sun is one of many;
(3) Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), who built on Copernicus'
discovery, was a better and more influential scientist,
anticipating some of Galileo's concepts;
and (4) the Scientific Revolution didn't really get underway
until the invention of the telescope, which would have soon
led to the discovery of heliocentrism in any event.

</p><p>Until the Protestant Reformation, which began about the time
of Copernicus' discovery, European scientists were reluctant to challenge
the Catholic Church and its belief in geocentrism.
Copernicus' book was published only posthumously.
It remains controversial whether earlier Islamic or Hindu mathematicians
(or even Archimedes with his <i>The Sand Reckoner</i>)
believed in heliocentrism, but
were also inhibited by religious orthodoxy.

Girolamo&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Cardano</b></font></u></font>
(1501-1576) Italy</a>
</p><blockquote>Girolamo Cardano (or Jerome Cardan) was a highly
respected physician and was first to describe typhoid fever.
He was also an accomplished gambler and
chess player and wrote an early book on probability.
He was also a remarkable inventor:
the combination lock, an advanced gimbal, a
ciphering tool, and the Cardan shaft with universal joints are all
his inventions and are in use to this day.
(The U-joint is sometimes called the Cardan joint.)
He also helped develop the camera obscura.
Cardano made contributions to physics: he noted that
projectile trajectories are parabolas, and may have been first
to note the impossibility of perpetual motion machines.
He did work in philosophy, geology, hydrodynamics,
music; he wrote books on medicine and
an encyclopedia of natural science.

<p>But Cardano is most remembered for his achievements in mathematics.
He was first to publish general solutions
to cubic and quartic equations,
and first to publish the use of complex numbers in calculations.
(Cardano's Italian colleagues deserve much credit:
Ferrari first solved the quartic, he or Tartaglia the cubic; and
Bombelli first treated the complex numbers as numbers in their own right.
Cardano may have been the <i>last</i> great mathematician
unwilling to deal with negative numbers: his treatment of cubic
equations had to deal with <i>ax<sup>3</sup> - bx + c = 0</i>
and <i>ax<sup>3</sup> - bx = c</i> as
two different cases.)
Cardano introduced binomial coefficients and the Binomial
Theorem, and introduced and solved the geometric
hypocycloid problem, as well as other geometric theorems
(e.g. the theorem underlying the 2:1 spur wheel
which converts circular to reciprocal rectilinear motion).
Cardano is credited with <i>Cardano's Ring Puzzle</i>,
still manufactured today and related to the
<i>Tower of Hanoi</i> puzzle.
(This puzzle may predate Cardano, and may even have been
known in ancient China.)
Da Vinci and Galileo may have been more influential
than Cardano, but of the three great generalists
in the century before Kepler, it seems clear that Cardano was the
most accomplished mathematician.

</p><p>Cardano's life had tragic elements.
Throughout his life he was tormented that his
father (a friend of Leonardo da Vinci) married
his mother only after Cardano was born.
(And his mother tried several times to abort him.)
Cardano's reputation for gambling and aggression interfered
with his career.
He practiced astrology and was imprisoned for heresy
when he cast a horoscope for Jesus.
(This and other problems were due in part to
revenge by Tartaglia for Cardano's
revealing his secret algebra formulae.)
His son apparently murdered his own wife.
Leibniz wrote of Cardano:
"Cardano was a great man with all his faults;

Fran�ois&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Vi�te</b></font></u></font>
(1540-1603) France</a>
</p><blockquote>Fran�ois Vi�te (or Franciscus Vieta) was a French
nobleman and lawyer who was a favorite of King Henry IV and eventually
became a royal privy councillor.
In one notable accomplishment he broke the Spanish diplomatic code,
allowing the French government to read Spain's messages and
publish a secret Spanish letter; this apparently led to the end
of the Huguenot Wars of Religion.

<p>More importantly, Vieta was certainly
the best French mathematician prior to Descartes and Fermat.
He laid the groundwork for modern mathematics;
his works were the primary teaching for both Descartes and Fermat;
Isaac Newton also studied Vieta.
In his role as a young tutor Vieta used decimal numbers before they
were popularized by Simon Stevin and may have guessed
that planetary orbits were ellipses before Kepler.
Vieta did work in geometry, reconstructing and publishing proofs
for Apollonius' lost theorems, including all ten cases of the
general <i>Problem of Apollonius</i>.
Vieta also used his new algebraic techniques
to construct a regular heptagon; he also doscovered
the <i>Vieta's formulas</i> which connect a polynomial's
roots to its coefficients.
He discovered several trigonometric identities including
a generalization of Ptolemy's Formula,
the latter (then called <i>prosthaphaeresis</i>)
providing a calculation shortcut similar to logarithms in that
multiplication is reduced to
addition (or exponentiation reduced to multiplication).
Vieta also used trigonometry to find real solutions
to cubic equations for which the Italian methods had
required complex-number arithmetic; he also used trigonometry
to solve a particular 45th-degree equation that had been
posed as a challenge.
Such trigonometric formulae revolutionized calculations and may
even have helped stimulate the development and use of
logarithms by Napier and Kepler.
He developed the first infinite-product formula for <b>&#960;</b>.
In addition to his geometry and trigonometry, he also
found results in number theory, but
Vieta is most famous for his systematic use of decimal notation
and variable letters, for which he is sometimes called the "Father of
Modern Algebra."
(Vieta used A,E,I,O,U for unknowns and consonants for parameters;
it was Descartes who first used X,Y,Z for unknowns and A,B,C for parameters.)
In his works Vieta emphasized the relationships between algebraic
expressions and geometric constructions.
One key insight he had is that addends must be homogeneous
(i.e., "apples shouldn't be added to oranges"), a seemingly trivial idea
but which can aid intuition even today.

</p><p>Descartes, who once wrote "I began where Vieta finished," is
now extremely famous, while Vieta is much less known.  (He isn't
<i>even mentioned once</i> in Bell's famous <i>Men of Mathematics</i>.)
Many would now agree this is due in large measure to Descartes'
deliberate deprecations of competitors in his quest for personal glory.
(Vieta wasn't particularly humble either, calling himself
the "French Apollonius.")

</tt>
</small></pre><small>
</small>
<p>Vieta's formula for <b>&#960;</b> is clumsy to express
without trigonometry, even with modern notation.
Easiest may be to consider it the result of the BASIC program above.
Using this formula, Vieta constructed an approximation to <b>&#960;</b>
that was best-yet by a European, though not as accurate as al-Kashi's
two centuries earlier.

<blockquote>Bruno wrote on mnemonics, philosophy, cosmology
and more, and further developed Nicholas of Cusa's
<i>pandeism</i> (though it wasn't then known by that name).
He embraced not only Copernicus' notion that the Earth rotates around
the Sun, but thought the Sun itself moved and that, as Nicholas
had conjectured, the universe was infinite and teemed with other worlds.
This is a conclusion the great Kepler did <i>not</i> make.
(Galileo's stance on this question is ambiguous: he knew the price
Bruno had paid for expressing this belief.)
Bruno was egotistical and obnoxious, and his teachings (most
especially his belief in multiple solar systems) infuriated the
Roman Church, which had him hung upside-down, spikes driven through his
mouth so he could not utter further heresies, and burned alive.
Before his execution he was tortured for seven years but never recanted,
instead saying "Maybe you who condemn me are in greater fear than I
who am condemned."
<p>One historian claims that it was Bruno's publications in 1584 and their
influence that defined the transition from medieval thought to modern
scientific thought.
William Gilbert (who laid the foundations of electricity and magnetism,
which is called the first important scientific discovery by an Englishman),
acknowledged the influence of Bruno's cosmology.
The Revolution started by Nicholas and Bruno was a revolt against
the Church's embracing Aristotle's teachings, as Bruno made clear when
he wrote "There is no absolute up or down, as Aristotle taught;
no absolute position in space.... Everywhere there is incessant relative
change ... and the observer is always at the centre of things."
Bruno made few mathematical discoveries, if any; but some consider him to be
one of history's great geniuses, in a class with Johann von Goethe,
Leonardo da Vinci, Francis Bacon, Voltaire, Nietzsche, and some of the
very greatest mathematicians.

trigonometry, optics, geography, and astronomy.

suggested a decimal metric
system, which was finally adopted 200 years later;
invented other basic notation like the symbol <large><b>&#8730;</b></large>.
Stevin proved several theorems about perspective geometry,
an important result in mechanics, and special cases of

<p><a name="Galileo" title="Ranked at � #75"><font size="+1"><u>
<font color="#a00000"><b>Galileo&nbsp;</b></font> Galilei</u></font>
(1564-1642) Italy</a>
</p><blockquote>Galileo discovered the laws of inertia (including rudimentary
forms of all three of Newton's laws of motion), falling bodies (including
parabolic trajectories), and the pendulum; he also introduced the notion
of relativity which later physicists found so fruitful.
Galileo discovered important principles of dynamics, including the
essential notion that the vector sum of forces produce an
acceleration.
(Aristotle seems not to have considered the notion of acceleration,
though his successor Strato of Lampsacus did write on it.)
Galileo is famous for dropping balls of different weights from
the Tower of Pisa, but this experiment may not have taken place at all.
Instead Galileo derived his famous result that weight cannot determine
falling speed via one of the first <i>thought experiments</i>!
Galileo may have been first to note that a larger body has less
relative cohesive strength than a smaller body.
He was a great inventor: in addition to being first to conceive
of a pendulum clock and of a thermometer, he developed
a new type of pump, the first compound-lens microscope,
and the best telescope, hydrostatic balance,
and cannon sector of his day.
As a famous astronomer, Galileo
pointed out that Jupiter's Moons, which he discovered, provide
a natural clock and allow a universal time to be determined
by telescope anywhere on Earth.
(This was of little use in ocean navigation since a ship's rocking
prevents the required delicate observations.
Galileo tried to measure the speed of light, but it was too fast for
him.  However 66 years after Galileo discovered Jupiter's moons
and proposed using them as a clock,
the astronomer Roemer inferred the speed of light from that 'clock':
the clock had a discrepancy of up to seven minutes depending
on the Earth-Jupiter distance.)
Galileo's several other astronomical achievements also included
confirming that the Milky Way was made up of stars, and discovering
sunspots and lunar craters.
<p>Perhaps Galileo's most important astronomical discovery was the phases
of Venus.  Ptolemy's epicycles, Copernicus' epicycles, and Kepler's ellipses
all gave almost the same solutions for planets' apparent positions,
<i>but Ptolemy's system gave completely wrong predictions about
the phases of Venus.</i>
Galileo's discovery of Venus' phases was the
critical fact which finally forced acceptance of heliocentrism.
(It's possible that Galileo's pursuit of Venus' phases was inspired in part
by Galileo's student, Benedetto Castelli.)
Just as modern inventors sometimes mail sealed envelopes to an
arbiter to establish precedence, Galileo sent an anagram to Kepler,
to later prove the date of his unpublished discovery.
(The anagram was <i>Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur o.y.</i> which
letters can be rearranged to <i>Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum</i>.
These two Latin sentences translate respectively as
"I am now bringing these unripe things together in vain, Oy!" and
"The mother of love [Venus] copies the forms of Cynthia [the Moon].")
</p><p>Galileo's contributions outside physics and astronomy
were also enormous:
He made discoveries with the microscope he invented, and
made several important contributions to the early
development of biology.
Perhaps Galileo's most important contribution
was the <i>Doctrine of Uniformity</i>, the postulate that
there are <i>universal</i> laws of mechanics, in contrast to
Aristotelian and religious notions
of separate laws for heaven and earth.

</p><p>Galileo is often called the "Father of Modern Science"
because of his emphasis on experimentation.
His use of a ramp to discover his Law of Falling Bodies
was ingenious.
(For his experiments he started with a water-clock to measure time,
but found the beats reproduced by trained musicians to be more convenient.)
He understood that results needed to be repeated and averaged
(he minimized mean absolute-error for his curve-fitting 
criterion, two centuries before Gauss and Legendre introduced
the mean squared-error criterion).
For his experimental methods and discoveries,
his laws of motion, and for (eventually) helping
to spread Copernicus' heliocentrism, Galileo may have been
the most influential scientist ever; he
ranks #12 on Hart's list of the Most Influential Persons in History.
(Despite these comments, it does appear that Galileo ignored
experimental results that conflicted with his theories.
For example, the Law of the Pendulum, based on Galileo's incorrect
belief that the tautochrone was the circle, conflicted
with his own observations.
Some of his other ideas were wrong; for example, he dismissed Kepler's
elliptical orbits and notion of gravitation and published a
very faulty explanation of tides.)
Despite his extreme importance to mathematical physics,
Galileo doesn't usually appear on
lists of greatest <i>mathematicians</i>.
However, Galileo did do work in pure mathematics;
he derived certain centroids and the parabolic shape
of trajectories using a rudimentary calculus,
and mentored Bonaventura Cavalieri, who extended Galileo's calculus;
he named (and may have been first to discover) the cycloid curve.
Moreover, Galileo was one of the first to write about
infinite equinumerosity (the "Hilbert's Hotel Paradox").
Galileo once wrote "Mathematics is the language in which God has written the
universe."
</p><p>(In my List I try to follow a consensus of mathematical historians.
Galileo made many mistakes, but top thinkers like Einstein declare that
his many contributions outweigh his flaws.
However <a href="http://intellectualmathematics.com/blog/why-galileo-is-like-nostradamus/">one
historian of mathematics argues that Galileo's flaws
are huge, and his contributions exaggerated.</a>
It may be wrong to include Galileo on our list, but I leave him at #75 for now.)

<p><a name="Kepler" title="Ranked at � #35"><font size="+1"><u>
Johannes&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Kepler</b></font></u></font>
(1571-1630) Germany</a>
</p><blockquote>Kepler was interested in astronomy from an early age,
studied to become a Lutheran minister,
became a professor of mathematics instead, then Tycho Brahe's understudy,
and, on Brahe's death, was appointed Imperial Mathematician at
the age of twenty-nine.
His observations of the planets with Brahe, along with his study
of Apollonius' 1800-year old work, led to Kepler's three Laws
of Planetary Motion, which in turn led directly to Newton's
Laws of Motion.
Beyond his discovery of these Laws (one of the most important
achievements in all of science), Kepler is also sometimes called
the "Founder of Modern Optics."
He furthered the theory of the camera obscura,
telescopes built from <i>two</i> convex lenses,
and atmospheric refraction.
The question of human vision had been
considered by many great scientists including Aristotle, Euclid,
Ptolemy, Galen, Alkindus, Alhazen, and Leonardo da Vinci,
but it was Kepler who was first to explain the
operation of the human eye correctly and to note that retinal
images will be upside-down.
Kepler developed a rudimentary notion of universal gravitation,
and used it to produce the best explanation for tides before Newton;
however he seems not to have noticed that his empirical laws
implied inverse-square gravitation.
Kepler noticed Olbers' Paradox before Olbers' time and used it
to conclude that the Universe is finite.
Kepler ranks #75 on Michael Hart's famous list of
the Most Influential Persons in History.  This rank, much lower than
that of Copernicus, Galileo or Newton, seems to me to underestimate Kepler's
importance, since it was Kepler's Laws, rather than just heliocentrism,
which were essential to the early development of mathematical physics.

<p>According to Kepler's Laws, the planets move at variable speed
along ellipses.
(Even Copernicus thought the orbits could be described with only circles.)
The Earth-bound observer is himself describing
such an orbit and in almost the same plane as the planets;
thus discovering the Laws would be a difficult challenge even for
someone armed with computers and modern mathematics.
(The very famous Kepler Equation relating a planet's
eccentric and anomaly is just one tool Kepler needed to develop.)
Kepler understood the importance of his remarkable discovery, even if
contemporaries like Galileo did not, writing:
</p><blockquote>
"I give myself up to divine ecstasy ... My book is written.
It will be read either by my contemporaries or by posterity �
I care not which.  It may well wait a hundred years for a
reader, as God has waited 6,000 years for someone to
understand His work."
</blockquote>
Kepler also once wrote "Mathematics is the archetype of the
beautiful."

<p>Besides the trigonometric results needed to discover his Laws,
Kepler made other contributions to mathematics.
He generalized Alhazen's Billiard Problem, developing the
notion of curvature.
He was first to notice that the set of Platonic regular solids
was incomplete if concave solids are admitted, and first
to prove that there were only 13 <i>Archimedean solids</i>.
He proved theorems of solid geometry later discovered on
the famous palimpsest of Archimedes.
He rediscovered the Fibonacci series, applied it to
botany, and noted that the ratio of Fibonacci numbers
converges to the <i>Golden Mean</i>.
He was a key early pioneer in calculus,
and embraced the concept of continuity
(which others avoided due to Zeno's paradoxes);
his work was a direct inspiration for Cavalieri and others.
He developed the theory of logarithms and improved on
Napier's tables.
He developed mensuration methods and
anticipated Fermat's theorem on stationary points.
Kepler once had an opportunity to buy wine, which merchants measured
using a shortcut; with the famous <i>Kepler's Wine Barrel Problem</i>,
he used his rudimentary calculus to deduce which barrel shape
would be the best bargain.

</p><p>Kepler reasoned that the structure of snowflakes was evidence
for the then-novel atomic theory of matter.
He noted that the obvious packing of cannonballs gave maximum
density (this became known as <i>Kepler's Conjecture</i>; optimality
was proved among regular packings by Gauss, but it wasn't until
1998 that the possibility of denser <i>irregular</i> packings
was disproven).
In addition to his physics and mathematics,
Kepler wrote a science fiction novel,
and was an astrologer and mystic.
He had ideas similar to Pythagoras about numbers ruling the
cosmos (writing that the purpose of studying the world
"should be to discover the rational order and harmony which
has been imposed on it by God and which He revealed to us in the language of
mathematics").
Kepler's mystic beliefs even led to his own mother being
imprisoned for witchcraft.

</p><p>Johannes Kepler (along with Galileo, Fermat,
Huygens, Wallis, Vieta and Descartes)
is among the giants on whose shoulders Newton was proud to stand.
Some historians place him ahead of Galileo and Copernicus as the single most
important contributor to the early Scientific Revolution.
Chasles includes Kepler on a list of the six responsible for
conceiving and perfecting infinitesimal calculus (the other five are
Archimedes, Cavalieri, Fermat, Leibniz and Newton).

and he finished as tutor to royalty, but in between
he achieved fame as the preeminent intellectual of his day.
He is considered the inventor of both analytic geometry and
symbolic algebraic notation and is therefore
called the "Father of Modern Mathematics."
His use of equations to partially solve the geometric Problem of Pappus
revolutionized mathematics.
Because of his famous philosophical writings ("Cogito ergo sum") he

most influential thinkers in history.
He ranks #49 on Michael Hart's famous list of

His famous mathematical theorems include the
Rule of Signs (for determining the signs of
polynomial roots), the elegant formula
relating the radii of <i>Soddy kissing circles</i>,
his theorem on total angular defect (an early form of
the Gauss-Bonnet result so key to much mathematics),
and an improved solution to the Delian problem (cube-doubling).
While studying lens refraction,
he invented the <i>Ovals of Descartes</i>.
He improved mathematical notation
(e.g. the use of superscripts to denote exponents).
He also discovered Euler's Polyhedral Theorem, <b>F+V = E+2</b>.
Descartes was very influential in physics and biology as well,
e.g. developing laws of motion which included a "vortex" theory of gravitation;
but most of his scientific work outside mathematics was eventually
found to be incorrect.

<p>Descartes has an extremely high reputation and would
be ranked even higher by many list makers, but whatever his
historical importance his mathematical skill was not in the
top rank.  Some of his work was borrowed from others,

He had only insulting things to say about Pascal and Fermat,
each of whom was much more
brilliant at mathematics than Descartes.

of Pascal's lost <i>Essay on Conics</i>.)
And Descartes made numerous errors in his development of
physics, perhaps even delaying science,
with Huygens writing "in all of [Descartes'] physics,
I find almost nothing to which I can subscribe as being correct."

Pierre de&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Fermat</b></font></u></font>
(1601-1665) France</a>
</p><blockquote>Pierre de Fermat was the most brilliant mathematician
of his era and, along with Descartes, one of the most influential.
Although mathematics was just his hobby (Fermat was a government lawyer),
Fermat practically founded Number Theory, and also played key
roles in the discoveries of Analytic Geometry and Calculus.
Lagrange considered Fermat, rather than Newton or Leibniz, to be the 
inventor of calculus.
Fermat was first to study certain interesting curves,
e.g. the <i>"Witch of Agnesi"</i>.
He was also an excellent geometer (e.g. discovering a
triangle's <i>Fermat point</i>),
and (in collaboration with Blaise Pascal) discovered probability theory.
Fellow geniuses are the best judges of genius, and Blaise
Pascal had this to say of Fermat:
"For my part, I confess that [Fermat's researches about numbers]
are far beyond me, and I am competent only to admire them."
E.T. Bell wrote "it can be argued that Fermat was
at least Newton's equal as a pure mathematician."

<p>Fermat's most famous discoveries in number theory
include the ubiquitously-used <i>Fermat's Little Theorem</i>
(that <i>(a<sup>p</sup>-a)</i> is a multiple of <i>p</i>
whenever <i>p</i> is prime);
the <i>n = 4</i> case of
his conjectured <i>Fermat's Last Theorem</i> (he may have
proved the <i>n = 3</i> case as well);
and <i>Fermat's Christmas Theorem</i>
(that any prime (4n+1) can be represented as the sum of two
squares in exactly one way) which may be considered the
most difficult theorem of arithmetic which had been
proved up to that date.
Fermat proved the Christmas Theorem with difficulty
using "infinite descent," but details are unrecorded, so the
theorem is often named the <i>Fermat-Euler Prime Number Theorem</i>,
with the first published proof being by Euler more than a century after
Fermat's claim.
Another famous conjecture by Fermat is that
every natural number is the sum of three triangle numbers,
or more generally the sum of k k-gonal numbers.
As with his "Last Theorem" he claimed to have a proof but
didn't write it up.
(This theorem was eventually proved by Lagrange for k=4,
the very young Gauss for k=3, and Cauchy for general k.
Diophantus claimed the k=4 case but any proof has been lost.)
I think Fermat's conjectures were impressive even if unproven,
and that this great mathematician is often underrated.
(Recall that his so-called "Last Theorem"
was actually just a private scribble.)

</p><p>Fermat developed a system of analytic geometry which both
preceded and surpassed that of Descartes; he developed methods of
differential and integral calculus which Newton
acknowledged as an inspiration.
Although Kepler anticipated it, Fermat is credited with Fermat's
Theorem on Stationary Points (<i>df(x)/dx = 0</i> at function extrema),
the key to many problems in applied analysis.
Fermat was also the first European to find the integration
formula for the general polynomial; he used his calculus
to find centers of gravity, etc.

</p><p>Fermat's contemporaneous rival Ren� Descartes is more famous
than Fermat, and Descartes' writings were more influential.
Whatever one thinks of Descartes as a <i>philosopher</i>,
however, it seems clear that Fermat was the better <i>mathematician</i>.
Fermat and Descartes did work in physics and independently discovered
the (trigonometric) law of refraction,
but Fermat gave the correct explanation, and used it
remarkably to anticipate the Principle of Least Action
later enunciated by Maupertuis (though Maupertuis
himself, like Descartes, had an incorrect explanation of refraction).
Fermat and Descartes independently discovered analytic geometry,
but it was Fermat who extended it to more than
two dimensions, and followed up by developing elementary calculus.

device could also be used as an altimeter.)
Torricelli was a skilled craftsman who built
the best telescopes and microscopes of his day.
As mathematical physicist, he extended Galileo's results, was
first to explain winds correctly, and discovered several key principles
including Torricelli's Law (water drains through a small hole with rate
proportional to the square root of water depth). 
In mathematics, he applied Cavalieri's methods to
solve difficult mensuration problems; he also wrote on possible pitfalls

He discovered <i>Gabriel's Horn</i> with infinite surface area but finite

John Brehaut&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Wallis</b></font></u></font>
(1616-1703) England</a>
</p><blockquote>Wallis began his life as a savant at arithmetic
(it is said he once calculated the square root of a 53-digit
number to help him sleep and remembered the result in the morning),
a medical student (he may have contributed to the concept
of blood circulation), and theologian, but went on to become perhaps the most
brilliant and influential English mathematician before Newton.
He made major advances in analytic geometry, but also
contributions to algebra, geometry and trigonometry.
Unlike his contemporary Huygens, who took inspiration from
Euclid's rigorous geometry, Wallis embraced the new analytic methods
of Descartes and Fermat.
He is especially famous for using negative and fractional exponents
(though Oresme had introduced fractional exponents three centuries earlier),
taking the areas of curves, and treating inelastic collisions
(he and Huygens were first to develop the law of momentum conservation).
He was a polymath; his non-mathematical work included a highly
respected English grammar; he introduced the (still controversial)
linguistic concept of phonesthesia.
<p>He was the first European to solve Pell's Equation.
Like Vieta, Wallis was a code-breaker, helping the Commonwealth
side (though he later petitioned against the beheading of King Charles I).
He was the first great mathematician to consider complex numbers legitimate;
he invented the symbol <b>&#8734;</b> (and used <b>1/&#8734;</b> to denote
infinitesimal).
Wallis coined several terms including <i>momentum</i>,
<i>continued fraction</i>, <i>induction</i>, <i>interpolation</i>,
<i>mantissa</i>, and <i>hypergeometric series</i>.

</p><p>Also like Vieta, Wallis created an infinite product formula for pi,
which might be (but isn't) written today as:

(1623-1662) France</a>
</p><blockquote>
Pascal was an outstanding genius who studied geometry as a child.
At the age of sixteen he stated and proved Pascal's Theorem, a
fact relating any six points on any conic section.
The Theorem is sometimes called the "Cat's Cradle"
or the "Mystic Hexagram."
Pascal followed up this result by showing that each of Apollonius'
famous theorems about conic sections was a corollary of the Mystic Hexagram;
along with G�rard Desargues (1591-1661),
he was a key pioneer of projective geometry.
He also made important early contributions to calculus;
indeed it was his writings that inspired Leibniz.
Returning to geometry late in life, Pascal advanced the theory of the cycloid.
In addition to his work in geometry and calculus, he
founded probability theory, and made contributions
to axiomatic theory.
His name is associated with the Pascal's Triangle
of combinatorics and Pascal's Wager in theology.

<p>Like most of the greatest mathematicians, Pascal was interested in
physics and mechanics, studying fluids, explaining vacuum,
and inventing the syringe and hydraulic press.
At the age of eighteen he designed and built the world's first automatic
adding machine.
(Although he continued to refine this invention,
it was never a commercial success.)
He suffered poor health throughout his life,
abandoned mathematics for religion at about age 23,
wrote the philosophical treatise <i>Pens�es</i>
("We arrive at truth, not by reason only, but also by the heart"),
and died at an early age.
Pascal is ranked #67 on the Pantheon Popular/Productive List.
Many think that had he devoted more years to mathematics,
Pascal would have been one of the greatest mathematicians ever.

(1629-1695) Holland, France</a>
</p><blockquote>Christiaan Huygens (or Hugens, Huyghens) was second
only to Newton as the greatest mechanist and theoretical
physicist of his era; he inspired Newton, who praised him above
the other 17th-century mathematicians.
Although an excellent mathematician, he
is much more famous for his physical theories and inventions.
He developed laws of motion before Newton, including
the inverse-square law of gravitation, centripetal force,
and treatment of solid bodies rather than point approximations;
he (and Wallis) were first to state the law of momentum conservation correctly.
He advanced the wave ("undulatory") theory of light,
a key concept being <i>Huygen's Principle</i>, that each point on a wave front
acts as a new source of radiation.
His optical discoveries include explanations for polarization
and phenomena like haloes.
(Because of Newton's high reputation and
corpuscular theory of light, Huygens' superior wave theory
was largely ignored until the 19th-century work of Young, Fresnel,
and Maxwell.
Later, Planck, Einstein and Bohr, partly anticipated by Hamilton,
developed the modern notion of wave-particle duality.)

<p>Huygens is famous for his inventions of clocks and lenses.
He invented the escapement and other mechanisms, leading to the
first reliable pendulum clock; he built the first
balance spring watch, which he presented to his
patron, King Louis XIV of France; he was first to give the
correct "equation of time" relating sundial time to
absolute time.
He invented superior lens grinding techniques,
the achromatic eye-piece, and the best telescope of his day.
He was himself a famous astronomer:
he discovered Titan, was first to
properly describe Saturn's rings and the Orion Nebula, and
estimated the Sun-Earth distance far more accurately than any predecessor.
He also designed, but never built, an internal combustion engine.
He promoted the use of an equal-tempered 31-tone music scale
to avoid the tuning errors in Stevin's 12-tone scale;
a 31-tone organ was in use in Holland as late as the 20th century.
Huygens was an excellent card player, billiard player,
horse rider, and wrote a book speculating about extra-terrestrial life.

</p><p>As a mathematician, Huygens did brilliant work in analysis;
his calculus, along with that of Wallis, is considered the
best prior to Newton and Leibniz.
He also did brilliant work in geometry,
proving theorems about conic sections, the cycloid and the catenary.
He was first to show that the cycloid solves the tautochrone
problem; he used this fact to design
pendulum clocks that would be more accurate
than ordinary pendulum clocks.
He was first to find the flaw in Saint-Vincent's
then-famous circle-squaring method;
Huygens himself solved some related quadrature problems.
He introduced the concepts of evolute and involute.
His friendships with Descartes, Pascal, Mersenne and others helped
inspire his mathematics; Huygens in turn was inspirational
to the next generation.
At Pascal's urging, Huygens published the first real
textbook on probability theory; he also
became the first practicing actuary.

</p><p>Huygens had tremendous creativity, historical importance,
and depth and breadth of genius, both in physics and mathematics.
He also was important for serving as tutor
to the otherwise self-taught Gottfried Leibniz
(who'd "wasted his youth" without learning any math).
Before agreeing to tutor him,
Huygens tested the 25-year old Leibniz by asking him
to sum the reciprocals of the triangle numbers.

James Gregory (Gregorie) was the outstanding Scottish genius of his century.
Had he not died at the age of 36, or if he had published more of his work,
(or if Newton had never lived,) Gregory would surely be appreciated
as one of the greatest mathematicians of the early Age of Science.
Inspired by Kepler's work, he worked in mechanics and optics; invented
a reflecting telescope; and is even
credited with using a bird feather as the first diffraction grating.
But James Gregory is most famous for his mathematics, making
many of the same discoveries as Newton did:
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
interpolation method, and binomial theorem.
He developed the concept of Taylor's series and used it to
solve a famous semicircle division problem posed by Kepler
and to develop trigonometric identities, including
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>tan</i><sup>-1</sup>x = x &nbsp; - &nbsp; x<sup>3</sup>/3 &nbsp; + &nbsp; x<sup>5</sup>/5 &nbsp; - &nbsp; x<sup>7</sup>/7 &nbsp; + &nbsp; ...</b> &nbsp; (for <b>|x| &lt; 1</b>)
<br>Gregory anticipated Cauchy's convergence test, Newton's identities
for the powers of roots, and Riemann integration.
He may have been first to suspect that quintics generally lacked
algebraic solutions, as well as that <b><i>&#960;</i></b> and <b><i>e</i></b> were
transcendental.
He produced a partial proof that the ancient "Squaring the Circle"
problem was impossible.
<p>Gregory declined to publish much of his work, partly in deference
to Isaac Newton who was making many of the same discoveries.
Because the wide range of his mathematics wasn't appreciated until long after
his death, Gregory lacks the historic importance to qualify for the Top 100.

<p><a name="Newton" title="Ranked at � #1"><font size="+2"><u>
Isaac&nbsp; (Sir)&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Newton</b></font></u></font>
(1642-1727) England</a>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Newton was an industrious lad who built marvelous toys
(e.g. a model windmill powered by a mouse on treadmill).
At about age 22, on leave from University, this genius began
revolutionary advances in mathematics, optics, dynamics,
thermodynamics, acoustics and celestial mechanics.
He is famous for his Three Laws of Motion
(inertia, force, reciprocal action) but, as
Newton himself acknowledged, these Laws weren't fully novel:
Hipparchus, Ibn al-Haytham, Descartes, Galileo and Huygens had all
developed much basic mechanics already; and Newton credits the First Law
to Aristotle.
However Newton was apparently the first person to conclude
that the ordinary gravity we observe on Earth is the very same
force that keeps the planets in orbit.
His Law of Universal Gravitation was revolutionary and due to
Newton alone.
(Christiaan Huygens, the other great mechanist of the era,
had independently deduced that Kepler's laws imply inverse-square
gravitation, but he considered the action at a distance in
Newton's theory to be "absurd.")
Newton published the Cooling Law of thermodynamics.
He also made contributions to chemistry, and was 
the important early advocate of the atomic theory.
His writings also made important contributions
to the general scientific method.
Newton's understanding of celestial motions went
far beyond his basic laws.  The precession of the equinox
had been noticed by Hipparchus (and ancient Egyptians
must have been aware of it) but the explanation for the precession
was first given by Newton: Earth's axial precession is
due to the tidal forces of Moon and Sun.
His other intellectual interests included theology,
and mysticism.
He studied ancient Greek writers like Pythagoras,
Democritus, Lucretius, Plato; and claimed that the
ancients knew much, including the law of gravitation.

</p><p>Although this list is concerned only with mathematics,
Newton's greatness is indicated by the huge range of his
physics: even without his Laws of Motion, Gravitation and Cooling,
he'd be famous just for his revolutionary work in optics, where
he explained diffraction, observed
that white light is a mixture of all the rainbow's colors,
noted that purple is created by combining red and
blue light and, starting from that observation, 
was first to conceive of a color hue "wheel."
(The mystery of the rainbow had been solved by earlier
mathematicians like Al-Farisi and Descartes, but
Newton improved on their explanations.  Most people
would count only six colors in the rainbow but, due to
Newton's influence, seven -- a number with mystic importance --
is the accepted number.  Supernumerary rainbows, by the way,
were not explained until the wave theory of light superseded
Newton's theory.)
He noted that his dynamical laws were symmetric in time; that
just as the past determines the future, so the
future might, in principle, determine the past.
Newton almost anticipated Einstein's mass-energy equivalence,
writing "Gross Bodies and Light are convertible into one another...
[Nature] seems delighted with Transmutations."
Ocean tides had intrigued several of Newton's predecessors; once
gravitation was known, the Moon's gravitational attraction
provided the explanation -- except that there are <i>two</i> high
tides per day, one when the Moon is farthest away.
With clear thinking the second high tide is also explained by gravity
but who was the first clear thinker to produce that explanation?
You guessed it! Isaac Newton.
(The theory of tides was later refined by Laplace.)
Newton's earliest fame came when he discovered the problem of
chromatic aberration in lenses, and designed the first reflecting telescope
to counteract that aberration; his were the best telescopes of that era.
He also designed the first reflecting microscope, and the sextant.

</p><p>Although others also developed the techniques independently,
Newton is regarded as the "Father of Calculus" (which he called
"fluxions"); he shares credit with Leibniz for the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
(that integration and differentiation are each other's inverse operation).
He applied calculus for several purposes:
finding areas, tangents, the lengths of
curves and the maxima and minima of functions.
Although Descartes is renowned as the inventor of analytic geometry,
he and followers like Wallis were reluctant even to use negative
coordinates, so one historian declares Newton to be "the first
to work boldly with algebraic equations."
In addition to several other important advances in analytic geometry,
his mathematical works include the Binomial Theorem,
his eponymous interpolation method,
the idea of polar coordinates,
and power series for exponential and trigonometric functions.
(The equation &nbsp;
<b><i>e</i><sup>x</sup> = <i>&#8721;</i> x<sup>k</sup> / k!</b> &nbsp;
has been attributed to Newton and called the "most important series in
mathematics," but, although he published some related trignometric
formulae, he doesn't seem to have published the exponential
series explicitly prior to Bernoulli's discoveries circa 1690.)
He contributed to algebra and the theory of equations;
he was first to state B�zout's Theorem;
he generalized Descartes' rule of signs.
(The generalized rule of signs was incomplete and finally
resolved two centuries later by Sturm and Sylvester.)
He developed a series for the arcsin function.
He developed facts about cubic equations
(just as the "shadows of a cone" yield all quadratic curves,
Newton found a curve whose "shadows" yield all cubic curves).
He proved, using a purely geometric argument of awesome ingenuity,
that same-mass spheres (or hollowed spheres) of any radius have equal
gravitational attraction: this fact is key to celestial motions.
(He also proved that objects <i>inside</i> a hollowed sphere
experience zero net attraction.)
He discovered Puiseux series (and proved the associated theorem)
almost two centuries before they were re-invented by Puiseux.
(Like some of the greatest ancient mathematicians,
Newton took the time to compute an approximation to
<b>&#960;</b>; his was better than Vieta's, though still
not as accurate as al-Kashi's.)

</p><p>Newton is so famous for his calculus, optics, and laws of
gravitation and motion, it is easy to overlook that he was also one of the
very greatest geometers.
He was first to fully solve
the famous Problem of Pappus, and did so with pure geometry.
Building on the "neusis" (non-Platonic) constructions of Archimedes
and Pappus, he demonstrated cube-doubling and that angles
could be <i>k</i>-sected for any <i>k</i>, if one is allowed a conchoid or
certain other mechanical curves.
He also built on Apollonius' famous
theorem about tangent circles to develop the technique
now called hyperbolic trilateration.
Despite the power of Descartes' analytic geometry,
Newton's achievements with synthetic geometry were surpassing.
Even before the invention of the calculus of variations, Newton
was doing difficult work in that field, e.g.
his calculation of the "optimal bullet shape."
His other marvelous geometric theorems included several about quadrilaterals
and their in- or circum-scribing ellipses.
He constructed the parabola defined by four given points,
as well as various cubic curve constructions.
(As with Archimedes, many of 
Newton's constructions used non-Platonic tools.)
He anticipated Poncelet's Principle of Continuity.
An anecdote often cited to demonstrate his brilliance is the problem
of the <i>brachistochrone</i>, which had baffled the best mathematicians in
Europe, and came to Newton's attention late in life.
He solved it in a few hours and published the answer anonymously.
But on seeing the solution Jacob Bernoulli immediately exclaimed
"I recognize the lion by his footprint."

</p><p>In 1687 Newton published&nbsp;
<i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>, often
called the greatest scientific book ever written.
The motion of the planets was not understood before Newton,
although the <i>heliocentric</i> system allowed Kepler to describe the
orbits.
In <i>Principia</i> Newton analyzed the consequences of his Laws of Motion
and introduced the Law of Universal Gravitation.
With the key mystery of celestial motions finally resolved,
the Great Scientific Revolution began.
(In his work Newton also proved important theorems about inverse-<i>cube</i>
forces, work largely unappreciated until Chandrasekhar's modern-day work.)
Newton once wrote "Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity,
and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things."
Sir Isaac Newton was buried at Westminster Abbey in a tomb
inscribed "Let mortals rejoice that so great an ornament to the human
race has existed."

</p><p>Newton ranks #2 on Michael Hart's famous list of
the Most Influential Persons in History.
(Muhammed the Prophet of Allah is #1.)
Whatever the criteria, Newton would certainly rank first
or second on any list of physicists, or scientists in general,
but some listmakers would demote him slightly on a list of
pure mathematicians:
his emphasis was physics not mathematics,
and the contribution of Leibniz
(Newton's rival for the title <i>Inventor of Calculus</i>)
lessens the historical importance of Newton's calculus.
One reason I've ranked him at #1 is a comment by
Gottfried Leibniz himself:
"Taking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the time when
Newton lived, what he has done is much the better part."

Gottfried Wilhelm von&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Leibniz</b></font></u></font>
(1646-1716) Germany</a>
</p><blockquote>Leibniz was one of the most brilliant and prolific
intellectuals ever; and his influence in mathematics (especially
his co-invention of the infinitesimal calculus) was immense.
His childhood IQ has been estimated as second-highest in all of history,
behind only Goethe's.
Descriptions which have been applied to Leibniz include
"one of the two greatest universal geniuses" (da Vinci was
the other); "the most important logician between Aristotle and Boole;"
and the "Father of Applied Science."
Leibniz described himself as "the most teachable of mortals."

<p>Mathematics was just a self-taught sideline for Leibniz, who was
a philosopher, lawyer, historian, diplomat and renowned inventor.
Because he "wasted his youth" before learning mathematics,
he probably ranked behind the Bernoullis as well as Newton
in pure mathematical talent, and thus he may be the only
mathematician among the Top Fifteen who was never the greatest
living algorist or theorem prover.
I won't try to summarize Leibniz' contributions to philosophy
and diverse other fields including biology; as just
three examples: he predicted the Earth's molten core,
introduced the notion of subconscious mind,
and built the first calculator that could do multiplication.
Leibniz also had political influence: he
consulted to both the Holy Roman and Russian Emperors;
another of his patrons was Sophia Wittelsbach (Electress of Hanover),
who was only distantly in
line for the British throne, but was made Heir Presumptive.
(Sophia died before Queen Anne, but her son
was crowned King George I of England.)

</p><p>Leibniz pioneered the common discourse of mathematics,
including its continuous, discrete, and symbolic aspects.
His ideas on symbolic logic weren't pursued and it was left
to Boole to reinvent this almost two centuries later;
but Frege, himself sometimes called the greatest logician
of all, wrote that Leibniz was "in a class by himself."
Mathematical innovations attributed to Leibniz include
the notations &#8747;<b>f(x)<i>d</i>x</b>,
<b><i>d</i>f(x)/<i>d</i>x</b>, &#8731;x,
and even the use of <b><i>a�b</i></b> (instead of
<b><i>a</i> X b</b>) for multiplication;
the concepts of matrix determinant and Gaussian elimination;
the theory of geometric envelopes;
and the binary number system.
He worked in number theory, conjecturing Wilson's Theorem.
He invented more mathematical terms than anyone, including
<i>function</i>, <i>analysis situ</i>, <i>variable</i>, <i>abscissa</i>,
<i>parameter</i> and <i>coordinate</i>.
He also coined the word <i>transcendental</i>, proving that
sin() was not an algebraic function.
His works seem to anticipate cybernetics and information theory;
and Mandelbrot acknowledged Leibniz' anticipation of self-similarity.
Like Newton, Leibniz discovered The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus;
his contribution to calculus was much more influential than Newton's,
and his superior notation is used to this day.
As Leibniz himself pointed out, since the concept of
mathematical analysis was already known to ancient Greeks,
the revolutionary invention was the <u>notation</u> ("<i>calculus</i>"),
because with "symbols [which] express the exact nature of a
thing briefly ... the labor of thought is wonderfully diminished."

</p><p>Leibniz' thoughts on mathematical physics had some influence.
He was one of the first to articulate the law of energy
conservation and may have written on the principle of least action.
He developed laws of motion that gave different insights
from those of Newton; his views on cosmology anticipated theories
of Mach and Einstein and are more in accord with modern
physics than are Newton's views.
Mathematical physicists influenced by Leibniz include not only Mach,
but perhaps Hamilton and Poincar� themselves.
But despite his huge contributions to mathematics and physical
sciences, Leibniz is most renowned for his contributions
to philosophy, where his "sublime eloquence" was compared to Plato.
He made too many contributions to several branches of
philosophy to summarize here; perhaps most famous were his
theory of monads in <i>Monadology</i> and his often-parodied
claim that we live in "the best of all possible worlds."

</p><p>Although others had found it independently
(including perhaps Madhava three centuries earlier),
Leibniz discovered and proved a striking identity
for <b>&#960;</b>:
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b><i>&#960;</i>/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...</b>

Jacob developed important methods for integral
and differential equations, coining the word <i>integral</i>.
He and his brother were the key pioneers in mathematics during the generations

<p>Jacob liked to pose and solve physical optimization problems.
His "catenary" problem (what shape does a clothesline take?)
became more famous than the "tautochrone" solved by Huygens.
Perhaps the most famous of such problems
was the brachistochrone, wherein Jacob recognized
Newton's "lion's paw", and about which Johann Bernoulli wrote:
"You will be petrified with astonishment [that]
this same cycloid, the tautochrone of Huygens,

Jacob did significant work outside calculus;
in fact his most famous work was the <i>Art of Conjecture</i>,
a textbook on probability and combinatorics which
proves the Law of Large Numbers, the Power Series Equation,
and introduces the Bernoulli numbers.
While studying compound interest he introduced the
constant <i>e</i>, though it was given that symbol by Euler.

Newton and Alberuni had also discovered them).
Jacob also did outstanding work in geometry, for example constructing
perpendicular lines which quadrisect a triangle.

calculus of variations.
Johann solved the catenary before Jacob did;
this led to a famous rivalry in the Bernoulli family.
(No joint papers were written; instead the Bernoullis,
especially Johann, began claiming each others' work.)
Although his older brother may have demonstrated greater breadth,
Johann had no less skill than Jacob,
contributed more to calculus,
discovered L'H�pital's Rule before L'H�pital did,
and made important contributions in physics, e.g. about
vibrations, elastic bodies, optics, tides, and ship sails.

<p>It may not be clear which Bernoulli was the "greatest."
Johann has special importance as tutor to Leonhard Euler,
but Jacob has special importance as tutor to his brother Johann.
Johann's son Daniel is also a candidate for greatest Bernoulli.

In probability theory he developed actuarial science, posed interesting

De Moivre was first to introduce the use of generating functions.
He was first to discover a closed-form formula for the Fibonacci numbers;

<p><a name="Euler" title="Ranked at � #4"><font size="+2"><u>
Leonhard&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Euler</b></font></u></font>
(1707-1783) Switzerland</a>
</p><blockquote>Euler may be the most influential mathematician
who ever lived (though some would make him second to Euclid);
he ranks #77 on Michael Hart's famous list of
the Most Influential Persons in History.
His colleagues called him "Analysis Incarnate."
Laplace, famous for denying credit to fellow mathematicians,
once said "Read Euler: he is our master in everything."
His notations and methods in many areas are in use to this day.
Euler was the most prolific mathematician in history
and is often judged to be the best algorist of all time.
Some scholars rank Euler's 1748 <i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</i>
above Descartes's <i>G�om�trie</i>, Gauss' <i>Disquisitiones</i>,
and even Newton's <i>Principia Mathematica</i>.
(This brief summary can only touch on a few highlights of Euler's work.
The ranking #4 may seem too low for this supreme mathematician,
but Gauss succeeded at proving several theorems which had stumped Euler.)

<p>Just as Archimedes extended Euclid's geometry to marvelous heights, so
Euler took marvelous advantage of the analysis
of Newton and Leibniz.
He also gave the world modern trigonometry;
pioneered (along with Lagrange) the calculus of variations;
generalized and proved the Newton-Giraud formulae;
and made important contributions to algebra,
e.g. his study of hypergeometric series.
He was also supreme at discrete mathematics,
inventing graph theory.
Euler wrote the first definitive treatise on continued fractions,
establishing several key theorems on that important topic.
Although the invention of generating functions is attributed to DeMoivre,
Euler took splendid advantage of the concept: for example,
letting p(n) denote the number of partitions of n, Euler found 
the lovely equation: &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b>&#931;<sub>n</sub> <i>p</i>(n) x<sup>n</sup>
= 1 / &#928;<sub>k</sub> (1 - x<sup>k</sup>)</b>
<br>The denominator of the right side here
expands to a series whose exponents all have the <b>(3m<sup>2</sup>+m)/2</b>
"pentagonal number" form; Euler found an ingenious proof of this now called
"one of his most profound discoveries", relevant in
the theory of elliptic modular functions.
Another marvelous theorem in partition theory due to Euler states
that the number of partitions of any n into distinct parts
equals the number of partitions of n into odd parts.
(Euler first proved this with generating functions; there is also an
exquisitely simple proof, mentioned more than a century later by Sylvester,
based on a very simple bijection.  I think it was Euler himself who
first discovered that bijection, but despite much Googling
I am unsure of this.)

</p><p>Euler was a very major figure in number theory: He proved that the
sum of the reciprocals of primes diverges (and is approx. ln (ln (p))
if the prime reciprocals up to 1/p are summed).
He invented the totient function and used it to generalize
Fermat's Little Theorem,
found both the largest then-known prime
and the largest then-known perfect number,
proved <b>e</b> to be irrational,
discovered (though without complete proof) a
broad class of transcendental numbers,
proved that all even perfect numbers
must have the Mersenne number form that Euclid had
discovered 2000 years earlier, and much more.
Euler was also first to prove several interesting theorems
of geometry, including facts about the <i>9-point Feuerbach circle</i>;
relationships among a triangle's altitudes, medians, and
circumscribing and inscribing circles;
the famous Intersecting Chords Theorem;
and an expression for a tetrahedron's volume in terms of its edge lengths.
Euler was first to explore topology, proving theorems
about the <i>Euler characteristic</i>, and the famous
Euler's Polyhedral Theorem, <b>F+V = E+2</b> (although it may have
been discovered by Descartes and first proved rigorously by Jordan).
Although noted as the first great "pure mathematician,"
Euler's pump and turbine equations revolutionized the design of pumps;
he also made important contributions to music theory,
acoustics, optics, celestial motions, fluid dynamics, and mechanics.
He extended Newton's Laws of Motion to rotating rigid bodies;
and developed the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation.
On a lighter note, Euler constructed a particularly
"magical" magic square.

</p><p>Euler is credited with the first proof of Fermat's Christmas
Theorem (a prime of the form <b>4k+1</b> is the sum of two
squares in exactly one way).  Along with three other theorems
mentioned in this mini-bio, this means Euler is credited with
no less than four of the "Ten Most Beautiful Theorems" selected
by a mathematics magazine.
In a separate list ("Hundred Most Important Theorems") prepared for
a 1999 math conference, Euler is credited with seven of the theorems,
well ahead of anyone but Euclid.
(Two of these seven theorems aren't otherwise mentioned in this mini-bio:
his famous solution to the K�nigsberg Bridges Problem,
and his solutions to Pell's Equation.)

</p><p>Euler combined his brilliance with phenomenal concentration.
He developed the first method to estimate the Moon's orbit (the three-body
problem which had stumped Newton), and he settled an arithmetic
dispute involving 50 terms in a long convergent series.
Both these feats were accomplished when he was totally blind.
(About this he said "Now I will have less distraction.")
Fran�ois Arago said that "Euler calculated without apparent effort,
as men breathe, or as eagles sustain themselves in the wind."

</p><p>Four of the most important constant symbols in mathematics
(<b><i>&#960;</i></b>, <b><i>e</i></b>,
<b><i>i</i></b> = &#8730;-1, and <b><i>&#947;</i></b> = 0.57721566...)
were all introduced or popularized by Euler,
along with operators like <b><i>&#931;</i></b>.
He did important work with
<i>Riemann's zeta function</i>
&nbsp; <b>&#950;(s) = &#8721; k<sup>-s</sup></b> &nbsp;
(although it was not then known
by that name); he anticipated the concept of
analytic continuation by showing
<b>&#950;(-1) = 1+2+3+4+... = -1/12</b>.
Euler started as a young student of the Bernoulli family,
and was Daniel Bernoulli's roommate in Saint Petersburg,
where Euler was first employed as a teacher of physiology.
But at age twenty-eight, Euler
discovered the striking identity &nbsp;
<b>&#950;(2) = <i>&#960;</i><sup>2</sup>/6</b> &nbsp;
This catapulted Euler to instant fame, since the
left-side infinite sum (<i>1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ...)</i>
was a famous problem of the time.
Euler and others developed alternate proofs and generalizations
of this "Basel problem," and of course the &#950; (zeta) function
is now very famous.

Among many other famous and important identities,
Euler proved the Pentagonal Number Theorem alluded to above
(a beautiful result which
has inspired a variety of discoveries), and the Euler Product Formula
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>&#950;(s) = &#8719;(1-p<sup>-s</sup>)<sup>-1</sup></b>
&nbsp; where the right-side product is taken over all primes <i>p</i>.
His most famous identity (which Richard Feynman
called an "almost astounding ... jewel")
unifies the trigonometric and exponential functions:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b><i>e</i><sup>i x</sup> = <i>cos</i> x + i <i>sin</i> x</b>.
(It is almost wondrous how the particular instance
<b><i>e</i><sup>i &#960;</sup>+1 = 0</b>
combines the most important constants and operators together.)

formulae for <i>&#960;</i>:

</p><blockquote>The reputations of Euler and the Bernoullis
are so high that it is easy to overlook that others
in that epoch made essential contributions to mathematical physics.
(Euler made errors in his development of physics, in some cases because
of a Europeanist rejection of Newton's theories in favor of
the contradictory theories of Descartes and Leibniz.)
The Frenchmen Clairaut and d'Alembert were two other great
and influential mathematicians of the mid-18th century.

<p>Alexis Clairaut was extremely precocious, delivering a
math paper at age 13, and becoming the youngest person ever
elected to the <i>Paris Academy of Sciences</i>.
He developed the concept of skew curves (the earliest precursor
of spatial curvature);
he made very significant contributions in differential
equations and mathematical physics.
Clairaut supported Newton against the Continental schools, and helped
translate Newton's work into French.
The theories of Newton and Descartes gave different predictions
for the shape of the Earth (whether the poles were flattened or
pointy); Clairaut participated in Maupertuis' expedition to Lappland to
measure the polar regions.
Measurements at high latitudes showed the poles to be flattened:
Newton was right.
Clairaut worked on the theories of ellipsoids and the three-body
problem, e.g. Moon's orbit.
That orbit was the major mathematical challenge of the day,
and there was great difficulty reconciling theory and observation.
It was Clairaut who finally resolved this,
by approaching the problem with more rigor than others.
When Euler finally understood Clairaut's solution he called it
"the most important and profound discovery that has ever
been made in mathematics."
Later, when Halley's Comet reappeared as he had predicted,
Clairaut was acclaimed as "the new Thales."

</p><blockquote>During the century after Newton, the Laws of Motion needed to be
clarified and augmented with mathematical techniques.
Jean le Rond, named after the Parisian church where he
was abandoned as a baby, played a very key role in that development.
His D'Alembert's Principle clarified Newton's Third
Law and allowed problems in dynamics to be expressed with
simple partial differential equations;
his Method of Characteristics then reduced those equations
to <i>ordinary</i> differential equations;
to solve the resultant linear systems,
he effectively invented the method of eigenvalues;
he also anticipated the Cauchy-Riemann Equations.
These are the same techniques in use for many problems
in physics to this day.
D'Alembert was also a forerunner in functions of a complex variable,
and the notions of infinitesimals and limits.
With his treatises on dynamics, elastic collisions,
hydrodynamics, cause of winds, vibrating strings,
celestial motions, refraction, etc., the
young Jean le Rond easily surpassed the efforts of his older
rival, Daniel Bernoulli.
He may have been first to speak of time as a "fourth dimension."
(Rivalry with the Swiss mathematicians led to d'Alembert's
sometimes being unfairly ridiculed, although it does seem true that
d'Alembert had very incorrect notions of probability.)

<p>D'Alembert was first to prove that every
polynomial has a complex root; this is now called the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
(In France this Theorem is called the D'Alembert-Gauss Theorem.
Although Gauss was first to provide a fully rigorous proof,
d'Alembert's proof preceded, and was more nearly complete
than, the attempted proof by Euler-Lagrange.)
He also did creative
work in geometry (e.g. anticipating Monge's Three Circle Theorem),
and was principal creator of the major encyclopedia of his day.
D'Alembert wrote "The imagination in a mathematician who creates

(He proved more strongly
that <i>tan x</i> and <i>e<sup>x</sup></i> are both
irrational for any non-zero rational <i>x</i>.
His proof for this was so remarkable for its time, that its
completeness wasn't recognized for over a century.)
He also conjectured that
<i><b>&#960;</b></i> and <i><b>e</b></i> were transcendental.
He made advances in analysis (including the
introduction of <i>Lambert's W function</i>)
and in trigonometry (introducing
the hyperbolic functions <i>sinh</i> and <i>cosh</i>);
proved a key theorem of spherical trigonometry,
and solved the "trinomial equation."

cosmology (conceiving of star clusters, galaxies and supergalaxies),
map-making (inventing several distinct map projections),

dynamics, and especially optics (several laws of optics carry his name).

proving Lambert's Theorem (the path of rotation of
a parabola tangent triangle passes through the parabola's focus).
Lagrange declared this famous identity, used to calculate cometary orbits,

(1736-1813) Italy, France</a>
</p><blockquote>Joseph-Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia)
was a brilliant man who advanced to
become a teen-age Professor shortly after first studying mathematics.
He excelled in all fields of analysis and number theory;
he made key contributions to the theories of
determinants, continued fractions, and many other fields.
He developed partial differential equations far beyond those
of D. Bernoulli and d'Alembert,
developed the calculus of variations far beyond that of the Bernoullis,
discovered the Laplace transform before Laplace did,
and developed terminology and
notation (e.g. the use of <i>f'(x)</i> and <i>f''(x)</i>
for a function's 1st and 2nd derivatives).
He proved fundamental Theorems of Group Theory.
(He did not complete the proof of Lagrange's Theorem -- that
the order of a subgroup always divides the order of the group.
Gauss, Cauchy, and Jordan each broadened the scope of this
important theorem.  Some other famous ancient
theorems turn out to be corollaries of this Lagrange's Theorem.)

<p>Lagrange laid the foundations for the theory of
polynomial equations which Cauchy, Abel,
Galois and Poincar� would later complete.
Number theory was almost just a diversion for Lagrange,
whose focus was analysis;
nevertheless he was the master of that field as well,
proving difficult and historic theorems including
Wilson's Theorem (<b>p</b> divides <b>(p-1)! + 1</b>
when p is prime);
Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem (every positive integer is the
sum of four squares);
and that <b>n�x<sup>2</sup> + 1 = y<sup>2</sup></b>
has solutions for every positive non-square integer <b>n</b>.
Lagrange's many contributions to physics
include understanding of vibrations (he found
an error in Newton's work and published the
definitive treatise on sound), celestial mechanics
(including an explanation of why the Moon keeps the same
face pointed towards the Earth),
the <i>Principle of Least Action</i>
(which Hamilton compared to poetry), and the discovery of
the Lagrangian points (e.g., in Jupiter's orbit).
Lagrange's textbooks were noted for clarity and inspired
most of the 19th-century mathematicians on this list.
Unlike Newton, who used calculus to derive his results but then worked
backwards to create geometric proofs for publication, Lagrange
relied only on analysis.
"No diagrams will be found in this work" he wrote in the preface to his
masterpiece <i>M�canique analytique</i>.

</p><p>Lagrange once wrote "As long as algebra and geometry have been
separated, their progress have been slow and their uses limited;
but when these two sciences have been united, they have
lent each mutual forces, and have marched together towards perfection."
Both W.W.R. Ball and E.T. Bell, renowned mathematical historians,
bypass Euler to name Lagrange as "the Greatest
Mathematician of the 18th Century."
Jacobi bypassed Newton and Gauss to call Lagrange "perhaps the greatest
mathematical genius since Archimedes."

was an industrious and creative inventor
who astounded early with his genius, becoming a professor of
physics at age 16.
As a military engineer he developed the new field of descriptive geometry,
so useful to engineering that it was kept a military secret for 15 years.
Monge made early discoveries in chemistry and helped promote
Lavoisier's work;
he also wrote papers on optics and metallurgy;
Monge's talents were so diverse that he became Minister of the Navy
in the revolutionary government, and eventually became a close friend
and companion of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Traveling with Napoleon he demonstrated great courage
on several occasions.

<p>In mathematics, Monge is called the "Father of Differential Geometry,"
and it is that foundational work for which he is most praised.
He also did work in discrete math, partial differential equations,
and calculus of variations.
He anticipated Poncelet's Principle of Continuity.
Monge's most famous theorems of geometry are the Three Circles Theorem
and Four Spheres Theorem.
His early work in descriptive geometry has little interest to pure
mathematics, but his application of calculus to the
curvature of surfaces inspired Gauss and eventually Riemann, and led
the great Lagrange to say "With [Monge's] application
of analysis to geometry this devil of a man will make
himself immortal."

</p><p>Monge was an inspirational teacher whose students included
Fourier, Chasles, Brianchon, Ampere, Carnot,
Poncelet, several other famous mathematicians, and perhaps
indirectly, Sophie Germain.
Chasles reports that Monge never drew figures in his lectures,
but could make "the most complicated forms appear in space ...
with no other aid than his hands, whose movements admirably supplemented
his words."
The contributions of Poncelet to synthetic geometry
may be more important than those
of Monge, but Monge demonstrated great genius as an untutored child,

His masterpiece was <i>M�canique C�leste</i>
which redeveloped and improved Newton's work on planetary motions
using calculus.
While Newton had shown that the two-body gravitation problem
led to orbits which were ellipses (or other conic sections),
Laplace was more interested in the much more difficult problems
involving three or more bodies.  (Would Jupiter's pull on Saturn
eventually propel Saturn into a closer orbit, or was
Saturn's orbit stable for eternity?)
Laplace's equations had the optimistic outcome that the solar
system was stable.

<p>Laplace advanced the nebular hypothesis of solar system origin, and
was first to conceive of black holes.
(He also conceived of multiple galaxies,
but this was Lambert's idea first.)
He explained the so-called secular acceleration of the Moon.
(Today we know Laplace's theories do not
fully explain the Moon's path, nor guarantee orbit stability.)
His other accomplishments in physics include theories about
the speed of sound and surface tension.
He worked closely with Lavoisier, helping to discover the elemental
composition of water, and the natures
of combustion, respiration and heat itself.
Laplace may have been first to note that the laws of mechanics
are the same with time's arrow reversed.
He was noted for his strong belief in determinism, famously replying to
Napoleon's question about God with: "I have no need of that hypothesis."

</p><p>Laplace viewed mathematics as just a tool for developing his
physical theories.
Nevertheless, he made many important mathematical discoveries
and inventions (although the Laplace Transform itself
was already known to Lagrange).
He was the premier expert at differential and difference equations,
and definite integrals.
He developed spherical harmonics, potential theory, and the
theory of determinants; anticipated Fourier's series;
and advanced Euler's technique of generating functions.
In the fields of probability and statistics he made key advances:
he proved the Law of Least Squares,
and introduced the controversial ("Bayesian") rule of succession.
In the theory of equations, he was first to prove that
any polynomial of even degree must have a real quadratic factor.

</p><p>Others might place Laplace higher on the List,
but he proved no fundamental theorems of <i>pure</i> mathematics
(though his partial differential equation for fluid dynamics
is one of the most famous in physics),
founded no major branch of pure mathematics,
and wasn't particularly concerned with rigorous proof.
(He is famous for skipping difficult proof steps with the
phrase "It is easy to see".)
Nevertheless he was surely one of the
greatest <i>applied</i> mathematicians ever.

</p><blockquote>Legendre was an outstanding mathematician who
did important work in plane and solid geometry,
spherical trigonometry,
celestial mechanics and other areas of physics,
and especially elliptic integrals and number theory.
He discovered and proved important corollaries to
to the pentagonal-number partition relationship discovered by Euler.
He found key results in the theories of sums of squares and
sums of k-gonal numbers.
(For example, he showed that all integers except <b>4<sup>k</sup>(8m+7)</b>
can be expressed as the sum of three squares.)
He also made key contributions in several areas of analysis:
he invented the Legendre transform and Legendre polynomials;
the notation for partial derivatives is due to him.
He invented the Legendre symbol; invented the study of zonal harmonics;
proved that <b>&#960;<sup>2</sup></b> was
irrational (the irrationality of <b>&#960;</b>
had already been proved by Lambert);
and wrote important textbooks in several fields.
Although he never accepted non-Euclidean geometry,
and had spent much time trying to prove the Parallel Postulate,
his inspiring geometry text remained a standard until the 20th century.
As one of France's premier mathematicians, Legendre did other
significant work, promoting the careers of Lagrange and Laplace,
developing trig tables, geodesic projects, etc.

<p>There are several important theorems proposed by Legendre
for which he is denied credit, either because his proof was
incomplete or was preceded by another's.
He proposed the famous theorem about primes in a
progression which was proved by Dirichlet; proved and used the
Law of Least Squares which Gauss had left unpublished;
proved the N=5 case of Fermat's Last Theorem which is credited
to Dirichlet; proposed the famous Prime Number Theorem
which was finally proved by Hadamard;
improved the Fermat-Cauchy result about
sums of k-gonal numbers but this topic wasn't fruitful;
and developed various techniques commonly credited to Laplace.
His two most famous theorems of number theory,
the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity
and the Three Squares Theorem (a difficult extension of Lagrange's
Four Squares Theorem), were each enhanced by Gauss a few years
after Legendre's work.
Legendre also proved an early version of Bonnet's Theorem.
Legendre's work in the theory of equations and
elliptic integrals directly inspired the achievements of Galois and Abel
(which then obsoleted much of Legendre's own work);
Chebyshev's work also built on Legendre's foundations.

</p><blockquote>Joseph Fourier had a varied career:
precocious but mischievous orphan,
theology student, young professor of mathematics
(advancing the theory of equations), then revolutionary activist.
Under Napoleon he was a brilliant and important teacher
and historian; accompanied the French Emperor to Egypt;
and did excellent service as district governor of Grenoble.
In his spare time at Grenoble he continued the work
in mathematics and physics that led to his immortality.
After the fall of Napoleon, Fourier exiled himself to England,
but returned to France when offered an important academic
position and published his revolutionary treatise on the
Theory of Heat.
Fourier anticipated linear programming, developing
Fourier-Motzkin Elimination and an early
version of the simplex method;
and also did significant work in operator theory.
He is also noted for the notion of dimensional analysis,
was first to describe the Greenhouse Effect, and continued
his earlier brilliant work with equations.

<p>Fourier's greatest fame rests on
his use of trigonometric series (now called <i>Fourier series</i>)
in the solution of differential equations.
Since "Fourier" analysis is in extremely common use among
applied mathematicians, he joins the select company of the
eponyms of "Cartesian" coordinates, "Gaussian" curve, and
"Boolean" algebra.
Because of the importance of Fourier analysis,
many listmakers would rank Fourier much higher than I have done;
however the work was not exceptional as <i>pure</i> mathematics.
Fourier's Heat Equation built on Newton's Law of Cooling;
and the Fourier series solution itself
had already been introduced by Euler, Lagrange and Daniel Bernoulli.

</p><p>Fourier's solution to the heat equation was counterintuitive
(heat transfer doesn't seem to involve the oscillations fundamental
to trigonometric functions):  The brilliance of Fourier's imagination
is indicated in that the solution had been <i>rejected</i>
by Lagrange himself.
Although rigorous Fourier Theorems were finally proved
only by Dirichlet, Riemann and Lebesgue,
it has been said that it was Fourier's
"very disregard for rigor" that led to his great achievement,
which Lord Kelvin compared to poetry.

Johann Carl Friedrich&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Gauss</b></font></u></font>
(1777-1855) Germany</a>
</p><blockquote>Carl Friedrich Gauss, the "Prince of Mathematics," exhibited
his calculative powers when he corrected his father's arithmetic before
the age of three. His revolutionary nature was demonstrated at age twelve,
when he began questioning the axioms of Euclid. His genius was confirmed
at the age of nineteen when he proved that the regular n-gon was constructible
if and only if it is the product of distinct prime Fermat numbers.
(He didn't complete the proof of the only-if part.
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Regular_Heptadecagon_Inscribed_in_a_Circle.gif" target="_new">Click
to see construction of regular 17-gon.</a>)
Also at age 19, he proved Fermat's conjecture that every number is
the sum of three triangle numbers.
(He further determined the number of distinct ways such a sum could be formed.)
At age 24 he published <i>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</i>, probably the
greatest book of pure mathematics ever.

<p>Although he published fewer papers than some other
great mathematicians, Gauss may be the greatest theorem prover ever.
Several important theorems and lemmas bear his name;
his proof of Euclid's Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
(Unique Prime Factorization) is considered the first rigorous proof;
he extended this Theorem to the Gaussian (complex) integers;
and he was first to produce a rigorous
proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
(that an n-th degree polynomial has n complex roots);
his Theorema Egregium ("Remarkable Theorem") that
a surface's essential curvature
derived from its 2-D geometry laid the foundation of differential geometry.
Gauss himself used "Fundamental Theorem" to refer to 
Euler's Law of Quadratic Reciprocity; Gauss was first to provide
a proof for this, and provided eight distinct proofs for it
over the years.
(This theorem is so special that it has more published proofs that any
other theorem except the Pythagorean Theorem.
Eisenstein, Kummer, Cauchy, Jacobi, Liouville, and Lebesgue
all discovered novel proofs of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.)
Gauss proved the n=3 case of Fermat's Last Theorem for Eisenstein
integers (the triangular lattice-points on the complex plane);
though more general, Gauss' proof was simpler than the real integer proof;
this simplification method revolutionized algebra.
He also found a simpler proof for Fermat's Christmas Theorem, by taking
advantage of the identity <b>x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> = (x + iy)(x - iy)</b>.
Other work by Gauss led to fundamental theorems in statistics, vector
analysis, function theory, and generalizations of
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

</p><p>Gauss built the theory of complex numbers into its modern form, including
the notion of "monogenic" functions
which are now ubiquitous in mathematical physics.
(Constructing the regular 17-gon as a teenager was actually an
exercise in complex-number algebra, not geometry.)
Gauss developed the arithmetic of congruences and became
the premier number theoretician of all time.
Other contributions of Gauss include
hypergeometric series,
foundations of statistics, and differential geometry.
He also did important work in geometry,
providing an improved solution to Apollonius' famous problem
of tangent circles, stating and
proving the <i>Fundamental Theorem of Normal Axonometry</i>,
and solving astronomical problems related to comet
orbits and navigation by the stars.
Ceres, the first asteroid, was discovered when Gauss was a young man;
but only a few observations were made before it disappeared into the
Sun's brightness.  Could its orbit be predicted well enough
to rediscover it on re-emergence?  Laplace, one of the most
respected mathematicians of the time, declared it impossible.
Gauss became famous when he used an 8th-degree polynomial equation
to successfully predict Ceres' orbit.
Gauss also did important work in several areas of physics,
developed an important modification to Mercator's map projection,
invented the heliotrope, and co-invented the telegraph.

</p><p>Much of Gauss's work wasn't published: unbeknownst to his colleagues it was
Gauss who first discovered non-Euclidean geometry (even
anticipating Einstein by suggesting physical space
might not be Euclidean),
doubly periodic elliptic functions,
a prime distribution formula,
quaternions, foundations of topology, the Law of Least Squares,
Dirichlet's class number formula,
the key Bonnet's Theorem of differential geometry
(now usually called Gauss-Bonnet Theorem),
the butterfly procedure for rapid calculation of Fourier series,
and even the rudiments of knot theory.
Gauss was first to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Functions of
a Complex Variable (that the line-integral over a closed
curve of a monogenic function is zero),
but he let Cauchy take the credit.
Gauss was very prolific, and may be the most
brilliant theorem prover who ever lived, so many would rank him #1.
But several others on the list had more <i>historical</i> importance.
Abel hints at a reason for this:
"[Gauss] is like the fox, who effaces his tracks in the sand."

</p><p>Gauss once wrote "It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, ...
which grants the greatest enjoyment.
When I have clarified and exhausted a subject,
then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again ..."

</p><blockquote>
Jakob Steiner made many major advances in synthetic geometry, hoping that
classical methods could avoid any need for analysis;
and indeed, like Isaac Newton, he was often able to equal or surpass methods
of analysis or the calculus of variations using just pure geometry;
for example he had pure synthetic proofs for a notable extension to Pascal's Mystic Hexagram,
and a reproof of Salmon's Theorem that cubic surfaces have exactly 27 lines.
(He wrote "Calculating replaces thinking while geometry stimulates it.")
One mathematical historian (Boyer) wrote "Steiner reminds one of Gauss
in that ideas and discoveries thronged
through his mind so rapidly that he could scarcely reduce them to order on paper."
Although the <i>Principle of Duality</i> underlying
projective geometry was already known, he gave it a radically
new and more productive basis, and created a new theory of conics.
His work combined generality, creativity and rigor.

<p>Steiner developed several famous construction methods, e.g.
for a triangle's smallest circumscribing and largest inscribing ellipses,
and for its "Malfatti circles."
Among many famous and important
theorems of classic and projective geometry,
he proved that the
Wallace lines of a triangle lie in a 3-pointed hypocycloid,
developed a formula for the partitioning of space by planes,
a fact about the surface areas of tetrahedra,
and proved several facts about his famous
Steiner's Chain of tangential circles and his famous "Roman surface."
Perhaps his three most famous theorems are
the Poncelet-Steiner Theorem (lengths constructible
with straightedge and compass can be constructed with straightedge
alone as long as the picture plane contains the center
and circumference of some circle), the Double-Element Theorem
about self-homologous elements in projective geometry,
and the Isoperimetric Theorem that among solids of equal
volume the sphere will have minimum area, etc.
(Dirichlet found a flaw in the proof of the Isoperimetric Theorem
which was later corrected by Weierstrass.)
Steiner is often called,
along with Apollonius of Perga (who lived 2000 years earlier),
one of the two greatest pure geometers ever.
(The qualifier "pure" is added to exclude such geniuses
as Archimedes, Newton and Pascal from this comparison.
I've included Steiner for his extreme brilliance and productivity:
several geometers had much more historic influence, and as <i>solely</i>
a geometer he arguably lacked "depth.")

</p><p>Steiner once wrote:
"For all their wealth of content, ... music, mathematics, and chess
are resplendently useless (applied mathematics is a higher plumbing,
a kind of music for the police band). They are metaphysically trivial,
irresponsible. They refuse to relate outward, to take reality for arbiter.
This is the source of their witchery."

At an early age, Niels Abel studied the works of the
greatest mathematicians, found flaws in their proofs, and resolved to
reprove some of these theorems rigorously.
He was the first to fully prove the general case of Newton's
Binomial Theorem, one of the most widely applied theorems in mathematics.
Several important theorems of analysis are named after Abel,
including the (deceptively simple) Abel's Theorem of
Convergence (published posthumously).
Along with Galois, Abel is considered one of the two founders of group theory.
Abel also made contributions in algebraic geometry
and the theory of equations.
<p><i>Inversion</i>
(replacing <b>y = f(x)</b> with <b>x = f<sup>-1</sup>(y)</b>)
is a key idea in mathematics (consider Newton's Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus); Abel developed this insight.
Legendre had spent much of his life studying elliptic integrals,
but Abel inverted these to get elliptic functions,
and was first to observe (but in a manuscript mislaid by
Cauchy) that they were doubly periodic.
Elliptic functions quickly became a productive field of mathematics,
and led to more general complex-variable functions,
which were important to the development of
both abstract and applied mathematics.

</p><p>Finding the roots of polynomials is a key mathematical
problem: the general solution of the quadratic equation was
known by ancients; the discovery of general methods for
solving polynomials of degree three and four is usually treated
as the major math achievement of the 16th century; so
for over two centuries
an algebraic solution for the general 5th-degree polynomial
(quintic) was a Holy Grail
sought by most of the greatest mathematicians.
Abel proved that most quintics did <i>not</i> have such solutions.
This discovery, at the age of only nineteen, would have quickly
awed the world, but Abel was impoverished, had few contacts,
and spoke no German.
When Gauss received Abel's manuscript he discarded it
unread, assuming the unfamiliar author was just another crackpot trying to
square the circle or some such.
His genius was too great for him to be ignored long,
but, still impoverished,
Abel died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-six.
His fame lives on and even the lower-case word
'abelian' is applied to several concepts.

Carl G. J.&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Jacobi</b></font></u></font>
(1804-1851) Germany</a>
</p><blockquote>Jacobi was a prolific mathematician who
did decisive work in the algebra and analysis of complex variables,
and did work in number theory
(e.g. cubic reciprocity) which excited Carl Gauss.
He is sometimes described as the successor to Gauss.
As an algorist (manipulator of involved algebraic expressions),
he may have been surpassed only by Euler and Ramanujan.
He was also a very highly regarded teacher.
In mathematical physics, Jacobi perfected Hamilton's
principle of stationary action, and made other important advances.

<p>Jacobi's most significant early achievement was the theory
of elliptic functions, e.g. his fundamental result about
functions with multiple periods.
Jacobi was the first to apply elliptic functions to number theory,
extending Lagrange's famous Four-Squares Theorem to show
in <i>how many distinct ways</i>
a given integer can be expressed as the sum of four squares.
He also made important discoveries in many other areas including
theta functions (e.g. his Jacobi Triple Product Identity),
higher fields, number theory, algebraic geometry,
differential equations, q-series, hypergeometric series,
determinants, Abelian functions, and dynamics.
He devised the algorithms still used to calculate eigenvectors
and for other important matrix manipulations.
The range of his work is suggested by the fact that the
"Hungarian method," an efficient solution to an optimization
problem published more than a century after Jacobi's death,
has since been found among Jacobi's papers.

</p><p>Like Abel, as a young man
Jacobi attempted to factor the general quintic equation.
Unlike Abel, he seems never to have considered proving its
impossibility.
This fact is sometimes cited to show that despite Jacobi's
creativity, his ill-fated contemporary was the more brilliant genius.

Lejeune&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Dirichlet</b></font></u></font>
(1805-1859) Germany</a>
</p><blockquote>Dirichlet was preeminent in algebraic and analytic
number theory, but did advanced work in several other fields as well:
He discovered the modern definition of function,
the Voronoi diagram of geometry, and important concepts in
differential equations, topology, and statistics.
His proofs were noted both for great ingenuity and unprecedented rigor.
As an example of his careful rigor, he found a fundamental flaw
in Steiner's Isoperimetric Theorem proof which no one else had noticed.
In addition to his own discoveries, Dirichlet played a key role in
interpreting the work of Gauss,
and was an influential teacher,
mentoring famous mathematicians like
Bernhard Riemann (who considered Dirichlet second only to Gauss
among living mathematicians),
Leopold Kronecker and Gotthold Eisenstein.

<p>As an impoverished lad Dirichlet spent his money on
math textbooks; Gauss' masterwork became his life-long companion.
Fermat and Euler had proved the impossibility of
<b>x<sup>k</sup> + y<sup>k</sup> = z<sup>k</sup></b>
for k = 4 and k = 3; Dirichlet became
famous by proving impossibility for k = 5 at the age of 20.
Later he proved the case k = 14 and, later still, may have helped
Kummer extend Dirichlet's quadratic fields, leading to proofs of
more cases.
More important than his work with Fermat's Last Theorem
was his Unit Theorem, considered one of the most important
theorems of algebraic number theory.
The Unit Theorem is unusually difficult to prove;
it is said that Dirichlet discovered the proof while listening to music
in the Sistine Chapel.
A key step in the proof uses <i>Dirichlet's Pigeonhole Principle</i>,
a trivial idea but which Dirichlet applied with great ingenuity.

</p><p>Dirichlet did seminal work in analysis and is
considered the founder of analytic number theory.
He invented a method of L-series to prove the important
theorem (Gauss' conjecture)
that any arithmetic series (without a common factor) has an
infinity of primes.
It was Dirichlet who proved the fundamental Theorem of Fourier
series: that periodic analytic functions
can always be represented as a simple
trigonometric series.
Although he never proved it rigorously, he is especially noted
for the <i>Dirichlet's Principle</i> which posits the existence
of certain solutions in the calculus of variations,
and which Riemann found to be particularly fruitful.
Other fundamental results Dirichlet contributed to analysis and
number theory include
a theorem about Diophantine approximations
and his <i>Class Number Formula</i>.

William Rowan (Sir)&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Hamilton</b></font></u></font>
(1805-1865) Ireland</a>
</p><blockquote>Hamilton was a childhood prodigy.
Home-schooled and self-taught,
he started as a student of languages and literature,
was influenced by an arithmetic prodigy his own age,
read Euclid, Newton and Lagrange, found an error
by Laplace, and made new discoveries in optics;
all this before the age of seventeen when he first
attended school.
At college he enjoyed unprecedented success
in all fields, but his
undergraduate days were cut short abruptly by his
appointment as Royal Astronomer of Ireland at the age of 22.
He soon began publishing his revolutionary treatises on optics,
in which he developed Hamilton's Principle of Stationary Action.
This Principle refined and corrected the earlier principles of
least action developed by Maupertuis, Fermat, and Euler;
it (and related principles) are key to much of modern physics.
His early writing also predicted that some crystals would have an hitherto
unknown "conical" refraction mode; this was soon confirmed experimentally.

<p>Hamilton's Principle of Least Action, and its associated equations
and concept of configuration space, led to
a revolution in mathematical physics.
Since Maupertuis had named this Principle a century
earlier, it is possible to underestimate Hamilton's contribution.
However Maupertuis, along with others credited with anticipating
the idea (Fermat, Leibniz, Euler and Lagrange) failed to
state the full Principle correctly.
Rather than minimizing action, physical systems sometimes achieve
a non-minimal but <i>stationary</i> action in configuration space.
(Poisson and d' Alembert had noticed exceptions to Euler-Lagrange
least action, but failed to find Hamilton's solution.
Jacobi also deserves some credit for the Principle, but his
work came after reading Hamilton.)
Because of this Principle, as well as his wave-particle duality
(which would be further developed by Planck
and Einstein), Hamilton
can be considered a major early influence on quantum theory.

</p><p>Hamilton also made revolutionary contributions
to dynamics, differential equations, the theory of equations,
numerical analysis, fluctuating functions,
and graph theory (he marketed a puzzle based on his <i>Hamiltonian paths</i>).
He invented the ingenious hodograph.
He coined several mathematical terms including
<i>vector</i>, <i>scalar</i>, <i>associative</i>, and <i>tensor</i>.
In addition to his brilliance and creativity, Hamilton was
renowned for thoroughness and produced voluminous writings
on several subjects.

</p><p>Hamilton himself considered his greatest accomplishment
to be the development of quaternions, a non-Abelian field to
handle 3-D rotations.
While there is no 3-D analog to the
Gaussian complex-number plane
(based on the equation &nbsp; <b><i>i</i><sup>2</sup> = -1</b> &nbsp;),
quaternions derive from a 4-D analog based on
&nbsp; <b><i>i</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>j</i><sup>2</sup> =
<i>k</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>ijk</i> = -<i>jik</i> = -1</b>.
Although matrix and tensor methods may seem more general,
quaternions are still in wide engineering use because of
practical advantages, e.g. avoidance of "gimbal lock."
During his work with quaternions, Hamilton proved what is now
called the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, though its generalizations
were proven by Cayley and Frobenius.

</p><p>Hamilton once wrote:
"On earth there is nothing great but man;
in man there is nothing great but mind."

important results in differential equations,
differential algebra, differential geometry;
a key result about conformal mappings;

In addition to multiple Liouville Theorems, there are two
"Liouville Principles": a fundamental result in differential algebra,

Liouville was hugely prolific in number theory

Galois, who died before the age of twenty-one, not only never
became a professor, but was barely allowed to study as
an undergraduate.
His output of papers, mostly published posthumously,
is much smaller than most of the others on this list, yet it is
considered among the most awesome works in mathematics.
He applied group theory to the theory of equations,
revolutionizing both fields.
(Galois coined the mathematical term <i>group</i>.)
While Abel was the first to prove that some polynomial
equations had no algebraic solutions, Galois established
the necessary and sufficient condition for algebraic solutions to exist.
His principal treatise was a letter he wrote
the night before his fatal duel, of which
Hermann Weyl wrote: "This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity
of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in
the whole literature of mankind."

<p>Galois' ideas were very far-reaching; for example he is
credited as first to prove that trisecting a general angle with
Plato's rules is impossible.
Galois is sometimes cited (instead of Archimedes, Gauss or
Ramanujan) as "the greatest mathematical genius ever."
But he was too far ahead of his time -- the top mathematicians of
his day rejected his theory as "incomprehensible."
Galois was persecuted for his Republican politics, imprisoned,
and forced to fight a duel, where he was left to bleed out
without medical attention.
His last words (spoken to his brother) were
"Ne pleure pas, Alfred!
J'ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir � vingt ans!"
This tormented life, with its pointless early end, is one

the primitives of calculus, developed the concept
of uniform convergence, and was
then able to prove several fundamental but hitherto
unproven theorems.
Starting strictly from the integers,
he also applied his axiomatic methods to a definition
of irrational numbers.
He developed important new insights in other fields
including the calculus of variations, elliptic functions, and trigonometry.
Weierstrass shocked his colleagues when he demonstrated
a continuous function which is differentiable nowhere.
(Both this and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem were rediscoveries
of forgotten results by the under-published Bolzano.)
He found simpler proofs of many existing theorems, including
Gauss' Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and the fundamental Hermite-Lindemann
Transcendence Theorem.
Steiner's proof of the Isoperimetric Theorem contained a flaw,
so Weierstrass became the first to supply a fully rigorous
proof of that famous and ancient result.
Peter Dirichlet was a champion of rigor, but Weierstrass
discovered a flaw in the argument for
Dirichlet's Principle of of variational calculus.

<p>Weierstrass demonstrated extreme brilliance as a youth,
but during his college years he detoured into drinking and dueling
and ended up as a degreeless secondary school teacher.
During this time he studied Abel's papers, developed results
in elliptic and Abelian functions, proved
the Laurent expansion theorem before Laurent did, and
independently proved the Fundamental Theorem of Functions of
a Complex Variable.
He was interested in power series and felt that others
had overlooked the importance of Abel's Theorem.
Eventually one of his papers was published in a journal;
he was immediately given an honorary doctorate

inspirational mathematicians in the world.
His insistence on absolutely rigorous proofs equaled

In addition to being very inventive,

(an era that includes Weierstrass and Poincar�).
Cayley was the essential founder of modern group theory,
matrix algebra, the theory of higher singularities,
and higher-dimensional geometry
(building on Pl�cker's work and anticipating the ideas of Klein),
as well as the theory of invariants.
Among his many important theorems are
the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem,
and Cayley's Theorem itself
(that any group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group).
He extended Hamilton's quaternions and developed the octonions,
but was still one of the first to realize that these special
algebras could often be subsumed by general matrix methods.
(Hamilton's friend John T. Graves independently discovered the
octonions about the same time as Cayley did.)
He also did original research in combinatorics (e.g. enumeration of trees),
elliptic and Abelian functions,
and projective geometry.
One of his famous geometric theorems is a generalization of
Pascal's Mystic Hexagram result; another resulted in an elegant
proof of the Quadratic Reciprocity law.

significant advances in analytic number theory, elliptic functions,

Along with Cayley and Sylvester,
he founded the important theory of invariants.
Hermite's theory of transformation allowed him to connect
analysis, algebra and number theory in novel ways.
He was a kindly modest man and an inspirational teacher.
Among his students was Poincar�, who said of Hermite, "He never

Methods always seemed to be born in his mind in some mysterious way."

<p>Although he and Abel had proved that the general quintic lacked
algebraic solutions, Hermite introduced an elliptic analog to the
circular trigonometric functions and used these to provide
a general solution for the quintic equation.
He developed the concept of complex conjugate which is now
ubiquitous in mathematical physics and matrix theory.
He was first to prove that the Stirling
and Euler generalizations of the factorial function are equivalent.
He was first to note remarkable facts about Heegner numbers, e.g.
<br><big><b>&nbsp; <i>e</i></b></big><b><i><sup><big>&#960;</big>&#8730;163</sup></i></b> = 262537412640768743.9999999999992...

ergodic theory, and approximation theory.
He provided key ideas about foundations and continuity
despite that he had philosophic objections to
irrational numbers and infinities.
He also introduced the Theory of Divisors to avoid Dedekind's Ideals;
the importance of this and other work was only realized long after
his death.
Kronecker's philosophy eventually led to the Constructivism

Georg Friedrich Bernhard&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Riemann</b></font></u></font>
(1826-1866) Germany</a>
</p><blockquote>Riemann was a phenomenal genius whose work
was exceptionally deep, creative and rigorous; he made
revolutionary contributions in many areas of pure mathematics,
and also inspired the development of physics.
He had poor physical health and died at an early age, yet is still
considered to be among the most productive mathematicians ever.
He made revolutionary advances in complex analysis, which he connected to
both topology and number theory.
He was among the first to consider spaces with an arbitrarily large
number of dimensions.
He applied topology to analysis, and analysis to number theory,
making revolutionary contributions to all three fields.
He introduced the Riemann integral which clarified analysis.
He developed the theory of <i>manifolds</i>, a term which he invented.
Manifolds underpin topology.
By imposing metrics on manifolds Riemann invented
differential geometry and took non-Euclidean geometry far
beyond his predecessors.
Riemann's other masterpieces include tensor analysis,
the theory of functions, and a key relationship between
some differential equation solutions and hypergeometric series.
His generalized notions of distance and curvature
described new possibilities for the geometry of space itself.
Several important theorems and concepts are named
after Riemann, e.g. the Riemann-Roch Theorem, a key connection
among topology, complex analysis and algebraic geometry.
He proved Riemann's Rearrangement Theorem, a strong (and paradoxical)
result about conditionally convergent series.
He was also first to prove theorems named after others, e.g. Green's Theorem.
He was so prolific and original that some of his work
went unnoticed (for example, Weierstrass became famous for showing
a nowhere-differentiable continuous function;
later it was found that Riemann had casually mentioned one
in a lecture years earlier).
Like his mathematical peers (Gauss, Archimedes, Newton), Riemann
was intensely interested in physics.
His theory unifying electricity, magnetism and light was
supplanted by Maxwell's theory; however modern physics, beginning
with Einstein's relativity, relies on Riemann's
curvature tensor and other notions of the geometry of space.

<p>Riemann's teacher was Carl Gauss, who helped steer the young
genius towards pure mathematics.  Gauss selected "On the hypotheses
that Lie at the Foundations of Geometry" as Riemann's first lecture;
with this famous lecture Riemann went far beyond Gauss' initial effort
in differential geometry, extended it to multiple dimensions, and
introduced the new and important theory of differential manifolds.
Five years later, to celebrate his election to the Berlin Academy,
Riemann presented a lecture "On the Number of Prime Numbers Less
Than a Given Quantity," for which "Number" he presented and
proved an <i>exact</i> formula, albeit weirdly complicated.
Numerous papers have been written on the distribution of primes,
but Riemann's contribution is incomparable, despite that
his Berlin Academy lecture was his only paper ever on the topic,
and number theory was far from his specialty.
In the lecture he posed the <i>Hypothesis of Riemann's zeta function</i>;
which has become the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics.
(Asked what he would first do, if he were magically awakened after
centuries, David Hilbert replied "I would ask whether
anyone had proved the Riemann Hypothesis.")
<b>&#950;(.)</b> was defined for convergent cases in Euler's mini-bio,
which Riemann extended via analytic continuation for all cases.
The Riemann Hypothesis "simply" states that
in all solutions of <b>&#950;(s = a+b<i>i</i>) = 0</b>,
either <b>s</b> has real part <b>a=1/2</b>
or imaginary part <b>b=0</b>.
As mathematicians developed methods to calculate the zeros of
the zeta function, eventually they found a clever better approach
in Riemann's unpublished notes.

</p><p>Despite his great creativity (Gauss praised
Riemann's "gloriously fertile originality;" another biographer called
him "one of the most profound and imaginative mathematicians of all time
[and] a great philosopher"),
Riemann once said: "If only I had the theorems!
Then I should find the proofs easily enough."

the theory of quadratic forms.
A famous problem of Eisenstein was, given <b><i>n</i></b>
and <b><i>k</i></b>, in how many different ways can <b><i>n</i></b>
be expressed as the sum of <b><i>k</i></b> squares?
Smith made great progress on this problem, subsuming special 
cases which had earlier been famous theorems.
Although most noted for number theory, he had great breadth.
He did prize-winning work in geometry, discovered the unique normal form
for matrices which now bears his name, anticipated specific fractals
including the Cantor set, the Sierpinski gasket and the Koch snowflake,
and wrote a paper demonstrating the limitations of Riemann integration.
<p>Smith is sometimes called "the mathematician the world forgot."
His paper on integration could have led directly
to measure theory and Lebesgue integration, but was ignored for decades.
The fractals he discovered are named after people who rediscovered them.
The Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula of lattice theory would be
called just the Smith formula, but had to be rediscovered.
And his solution to the Eisenstein five-squares problem, buried 
in his voluminous writings on number theory, was ignored:
this "unsolved" problem was featured for a prize which Minkowski won
two decades later!
</p><p>Henry Smith was an outstanding intellect with a modest
and charming personality.
He was knowledgeable in a broad range of fields unrelated
to mathematics; his University even insisted he run for Parliament.
His love of mathematics didn't depend on utility: he once wrote
"Pure mathematics: may it never be of any use to anyone."

(1831-1879) Scotland</a>
</p><blockquote>At the age of 14, Maxwell published a remarkable paper
on the construction of ovals;
these were an independent discovery of the <i>Ovals of Descartes</i>,
but Maxwell allowed more than two foci, had elaborate configurations
(he was drawing the ovals with string and pencil), and identified
errors in Descartes' treatment of them.
His genius was soon renowned throughout Scotland, with the future Lord Kelvin
remarking that Maxwell's "lively imagination started so many hares that
before he had run one down he was off on another."
He did a comprehensive analysis of Saturn's rings; developed
the important kinetic theory of gases; explored elasticity, viscosity,
knot theory, topology, soap bubbles, and more.
He introduced the "Maxwell's Demon" as a thought experiment for thermodynamics;
his paper "On Governors" effectively founded the field of cybernetics;
he advanced the theory of color, and produced the first color photograph.
One Professor said of him, "there is scarcely a single topic that
he touched upon, which he did not change almost beyond recognition."
Maxwell was also a poet.
<p>Maxwell did little of importance in pure mathematics, so
his great creativity in mathematical physics might not seem enough to
qualify him for this list,
although his contribution to the kinetic theory of gases
(which even led to the first estimate of molecular sizes) would
already be enough to make him one of the greatest physicists.
But then, in 1864 James Clerk Maxwell stunned the world by
publishing the equations of electricity and magnetism,
predicting the existence of radio waves and that light itself
is a form of such waves and is thus linked to the electro-magnetic force.
Richard Feynman considered this the most significant event of
the 19th century (though others might give higher billing to
Darwin's theory of evolution).
Along with Einstein, Newton, Galileo and Archimedes,
Maxwell would be the near-certain choice for a Five Greatest Physicists list.
Recalling Newton's comment about "standing on the shoulders" of
earlier greats, Einstein was asked whose shoulders <i>he</i>
stood on; he didn't name Newton: he said "Maxwell."
Maxwell has been called the "Father of Modern Physics"; he ranks #24 on
Hart's list of the Most Influential Persons in History.
(Faraday, the great experimentalist who noted the electromagnetic
effects which Maxwell later rendered in mathematics,
ranks #23 on Hart's list.)

Julius Wilhelm Richard&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Dedekind</b></font></u></font>
(1831-1916) Germany</a>
</p><blockquote>Dedekind was one of the most innovative mathematicians ever;
his clear expositions and rigorous axiomatic methods had great influence.
He made seminal contributions to abstract algebra and algebraic number theory
as well as mathematical foundations.
He was one of the first to pursue Galois Theory, making major advances there
and pioneering in the application of group theory to other branches
of mathematics.
Dedekind also invented a system of fundamental axioms for arithmetic,
worked in probability theory and complex analysis,
and invented prime partitions and modular lattices.
Dedekind may be most famous for his theory of ideals and rings;
Kronecker and Kummer had begun this, but
Dedekind gave it a more abstract and productive basis,
which was developed further by Hilbert, Noether and Weil.
Though the term <i>ring</i> itself was coined by Hilbert,
Dedekind introduced the terms <i>module</i>, <i>field</i>, and <i>ideal</i>.
Dedekind was far ahead of his time, so Noether became famous
as the creator of modern algebra; but she acknowledged her great predecessor,
frequently saying "It is all already in Dedekind."

<p>Dedekind was concerned with rigor, writing
"nothing capable of proof ought to be accepted without proof."
Before him, the real numbers, continuity, and infinity all
lacked rigorous definitions.
The axioms Dedekind invented allow the integers and rational
numbers to be built and his <i>Dedekind Cut</i> then led to a rigorous
and useful definition of the real numbers.
Dedekind was a key mentor for Georg Cantor:
he introduced the notion that a bijection implied equinumerosity,
used this to define infinitude (a set is infinite if
equinumerous with its proper subset),
and was first to prove the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr�der Theorem,
though he didn't publish his proof.
(Because he spent his career at a minor university,
and neglected to publish some of his work,
Dedekind's contributions may be underestimated.)

</p><blockquote>Cantor did brilliant and important work early in his career,
for example
he greatly advanced the Fourier-series uniqueness question which
had intrigued Riemann.  In his explorations of that problem he was led
to questions of set enumeration, and his greatest invention: set theory.
Cantor created modern Set Theory almost single-handedly,
defining cardinal numbers, well-ordering, ordinal numbers,
and discovering the Theory of Transfinite Numbers.
He defined equality between cardinal numbers based on the
existence of a bijection, and was the first to demonstrate that
the real numbers have a higher cardinal number than the
integers.
(He proved this with a famous diagonalization argument, a special
case of his elegant Cantor's Theorem.)
(He also showed that the rationals have the same cardinality
as the integers; and that the reals have the same cardinality
as the points of N-space and as the power-set of the integers.)
Although there are infinitely many distinct transfinite numbers,
Cantor conjectured that <i>C</i>, the cardinality of
the reals, was the second smallest transfinite number.
This <i>Continuum Hypothesis</i> was included in Hilbert's famous
List of Problems, and was partly resolved many years later:
Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis is an "Undecidable Statement"
of Set Theory.

<p>Cantor's revolutionary set theory attracted vehement opposition
from Poincar� ("grave disease"), Kronecker (Cantor was a "charlatan"
and "corrupter of youth"), Wittgenstein ("laughable nonsense"),
and even theologians.
David Hilbert had kinder words for it:
"The finest product of mathematical genius and one of the
supreme achievements of purely intellectual human activity"
and addressed the critics with "no one shall expel us from
the paradise that Cantor has created."
Cantor's own attitude was expressed with
"The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom."
Cantor's set theory laid the theoretical basis for the measure theory
developed by Borel and Lebesgue.
Cantor's invention of modern set theory
is now considered one of the most important and creative achievements
in modern mathematics.

</p><p>Cantor demonstrated much breadth
(he even involved himself in the Shakespeare authorship controversy!).
In addition to his set theory and key discoveries in the
theory of trigonometric series, he made advances in number theory,
and gave the modern definition of irrational numbers.

system of pure logic;

From his second-order logic he defined numbers, and derived
the axioms of arithmetic with what is now called Frege's Theorem.

because of his clumsy notation, partly because his system
was published with a flaw (Russell's antinomy).

Jules Henri&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Poincar�</b></font></u></font>
(1854-1912) France</a>
</p><blockquote>Poincar� founded the theory of algebraic (combinatorial)
topology, and is sometimes called the "Father of Topology"
(a title also used for Euler and Brouwer).
He also did brilliant work in several other areas of mathematics;
he was one of the most creative mathematicians ever,
and the greatest mathematician of the Constructivist
("intuitionist") style.
He published hundreds of papers on a variety of topics and might have
become the most prolific mathematician ever,
but he died at the height of his powers.
Poincar� was clumsy and absent-minded; like Galois,
he was almost denied admission to French University,
passing only because at age 17 he was already far too famous to flunk.

<p>Poincar� is most famous and important for his theorems
of topology, e.g. the Uniformization Theorem that geometries with
constant curvature can be imposed on any closed 2D-manifold;
but he also helped lay the foundations of homology;
he discovered automorphic functions (a unifying
foundation for the trigonometric and elliptic functions);
he essentially founded the theory of periodic orbits;
and he made major advances in the theory of differential equations.
He is credited with partial solution of Hilbert's 22nd Problem.
Several important results carry his name, for example the
famous Poincar� Recurrence Theorem, which almost seems to
contradict the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Poincar� is especially noted for effectively discovering chaos theory,
and for posing <i>Poincar�'s Conjecture</i>;
that conjecture was one of the most famous
unsolved problems in mathematics for an entire century,
and can be explained without equations to a layman.
The Conjecture is that all "simply-connected" closed manifolds
are topologically equivalent to "spheres"; it is directly
relevant to the possible topology of our universe.
Recently Grigori Perelman proved Poincar�'s conjecture,
and is eligible for the first Million Dollar
math prize in history.

</p><p>As were most of the greatest mathematicians,
Poincar� was intensely interested in physics.
He made revolutionary advances in fluid dynamics and
celestial motions; he anticipated Minkowski space
and much of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity
(including the famous equation <i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i>).
Poincar� also found time to become
a famous popular writer of philosophy, writing
"Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things;"
and "A [worthy] mathematician experiences in his work
the same impression as an artist; his
pleasure is as great and of the same nature;"
and "If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing,
and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living."
With his fame, Poincar� helped the world recognize the importance of the
new physical theories of Einstein and Planck.

He also produced the best calculus textbook of his time,

of analysis.
He was the champion of counter-examples, and found flaws in
published proofs of several important theorems.

<p>Most of the preceding work was done when Peano was quite young.
Later he focused on mathematical foundations, and this is the work
for which he is most famous.
He developed rigorous definitions and axioms for
set theory, as well as most of the notation of modern set theory.
He was first to define arithmetic (and then the rest
of mathematics) in terms of set theory.
Peano was first to note that some proofs required an explicit Axiom of Choice
(although it was Ernst Zermelo who explicitly formulated that Axiom a
few years later).

</p><p>Despite his early show of genius, Peano's quest for utter
rigor may have detracted from his influence in mainstream mathematics.
Moreover, since he modestly referenced work by predecessors like
Dedekind, Peano's huge influence in axiomatic theory is often overlooked.
Yet Bertrand Russell reports that it was from Peano
that he first learned that a single-member set is not the same

mathematician of the 20th century,
was unequaled in many fields of mathematics,
including axiomatic theory, invariant theory,
algebraic number theory, class field theory and functional analysis.
He proved many new theorems, including
the fundamental theorems of algebraic manifolds,
and also discovered simpler proofs for older theorems.
His examination of calculus led him
to the invention of <i>Hilbert space</i>,
considered one of the key concepts of functional analysis
and modern mathematical physics.
His Nullstellensatz Theorem laid the foundation of algebraic geometry.
He was a founder of fields like metamathematics and modern logic.
He was also the founder of the "Formalist" school which opposed the
"Intuitionism" of Kronecker and Brouwer.
He developed a new system of definitions and axioms
for geometry, replacing the 2200 year-old system of Euclid.
As a young Professor he proved his Finite Basis Theorem,
now regarded as one of the most important results of
general algebra.
His mentor, Paul Gordan, had sought the proof for many years, and
rejected Hilbert's proof as non-constructive.
Later, Hilbert produced the first constructive proof of the
Finite Basis Theorem, as well.
In number theory, he proved Waring's famous conjecture
which is now known as the Hilbert-Waring Theorem.
<p>Any one man can only do so much, so the
greatest mathematicians should help nurture their
colleagues.
Hilbert provided a famous List of 23 Unsolved
Problems, which inspired and directed the development
of 20th-century mathematics.
Hilbert was warmly regarded by his colleagues and students,
and contributed to the careers of several great mathematicians
and physicists including Georg Cantor, Hermann Minkowski,
John von Neumann, Emmy Noether, Alonzo Church, and Albert Einstein.
His doctoral students included Hermann Weyl, Richard Courant,
Max Dehn, Teiji Takagi, Ernst Zermelo, Wilhelm Ackermann, the chess

and eventually led him to the new field of Geometric Number Theory,
for which Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem (a sort of pigeonhole principle) is
often called the Fundamental Theorem.
Minkowski was also a major figure in the development of functional analysis.
With his "question mark function" and "sausage," he was also a
pioneer in the study of fractals.
Several other important results are named after him, e.g.
the Hasse-Minkowski Theorem.
He was first to extend the Separating Axis Theorem to multiple

Minkowski was one of Einstein's teachers, and also a close friend
of David Hilbert.

</p><blockquote>Albert Einstein was unquestionably one of the
two greatest physicists in all of history.
The atomic theory achieved general acceptance only after Einstein's
1905 paper, introducing the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation,
showed that atoms' discreteness explained Brownian motion.
Another 1905 paper introduced the famous equation
<b>E = mc<sup>2</sup></b>; yet Einstein published other papers
that same year, two of which were more important and influential
than either of the two just mentioned.
No wonder that physicists speak of the <i>Miracle Year</i>
without bothering to qualify it as <i>Einstein's Miracle Year</i>!
(Before his Miracle Year, Einstein had been a mediocre
undergraduate, and held minor jobs including patent
examiner.)
Altogether Einstein published at least 300 books or papers on physics.
For example, in a 1917 paper he anticipated the principle of the laser.
Also, sometimes in collaboration with Leo Szilard, he was co-inventor of
several devices, including a gyroscopic compass,
hearing aid, automatic camera and, most famously,
the Einstein-Szilard refrigerator.
He became a very famous and influential public figure.
(For example, it was his letter that led Roosevelt to start
the Manhattan Project.)
Among his many famous quotations is:
"The search for truth is more precious than its possession."

<p>Einstein is most famous for his Special and General Theories
of Relativity, but he should be considered the key pioneer of
Quantum Theory as well, drawing inferences from Planck's work that
no one else dared to draw.
Indeed it was his articulation of the quantum principle in a 1905 paper
which has been called
"the most revolutionary sentence written by a physicist of the
twentieth century."
Einstein's discovery of the photon in that paper led to his only Nobel Prize;
years later, he was first to call attention to the "spooky"
nature of quantum entanglement.
Einstein wrote one of the earliest key papers on particle-wave duality.
It was Einstein, not Bose, who had the key insights about Bose-Einstein
statistics and who postulated Bose-Einstein condensates, with attendant
notions like superconductivity. 
Einstein was also first to call attention to a flaw in Weyl's
earliest unified field theory.
But despite the importance of his other contributions it is Einstein's
General Theory which is his most profound contribution.
Minkowski had developed a flat 4-dimensional space-time to 
cope with Einstein's Special Theory; but it was Einstein
who had the vision to add curvature to that space
to describe acceleration.

</p><p>Einstein certainly has the breadth, depth, and historical importance
to qualify for this list; but his genius and significance were not in
the field of pure mathematics.
(He acknowledged his limitation, writing
"I admire the elegance of your [Levi-Civita's] method of computation;
it must be nice to ride through these fields upon the horse of
true mathematics while the like of us have
to make our way laboriously on foot.")
Einstein <i>was</i> a mathematician, however;
he pioneered the application of tensor calculus to physics
and invented the <i>Einstein summation notation</i>.
That Einstein's Equation of General Relativity explained a discrepancy
in Mercury's orbit was a discovery made by Einstein personally
(a discovery he described as 'joyous excitement' that gave
him heart palpitations).
He composed a beautiful essay about mathematical proofs
using the Theorem of Menelaus as his example. 
The sheer strength and diversity of his intellect is suggested by
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319091627/http://ponce.sdsu.edu/milestone_einstein.html">his elegant paper on river meanders</a>, a
classic of that field.
Certainly he belongs on a Top 100 List:
his extreme greatness overrides his focus away from math.
Einstein ranks #10 on Michael Hart's famous list of
the Most Influential Persons in History.
His General Theory of Relativity has been called the
most creative and original scientific theory ever.
Einstein once wrote "... the creative principle resides in mathematics
[; thus]
I hold it true that pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed."

Luitzen Egbertus Jan&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Brouwer</b></font></u></font>
(1881-1966) Holland</a>
</p><blockquote>Brouwer is often considered the "Father of Topology;"
among his important theorems were the Fixed Point Theorem,
the "Hairy Ball" Theorem,
the Jordan-Brouwer Separation Theorem,
and the Invariance of Dimension.
He developed the method of simplicial approximations,
important to algebraic topology;
he also did work in geometry, set theory, measure theory,
complex analysis and the foundations of mathematics.
He was first to anticipate forms like the <i>Lakes of Wada</i>,
leading eventually to other measure-theory "paradoxes."
Several great mathematicians, including Weyl, were inspired
by Brouwer's work in topology.

<p>Brouwer is most famous as the founder of Intuitionism,
a philosophy of mathematics in sharp contrast
to Hilbert's Formalism, but Brouwer's philosophy also
involved ethics and aesthetics and has been compared with
those of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.
Part of his mathematics thesis was rejected as
"... interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude
to life which is not mathematics ..."
As a young man, Brouwer spent a few years to develop
topology, but once his great talent was demonstrated
and he was offered prestigious professorships, he devoted
himself to Intuitionism, and acquired a reputation as
eccentric and self-righteous.

</p><p>Intuitionism has had a significant influence,
although few strict adherents.
Since only constructive proofs are permitted, strict adherence
would slow mathematical work.
This didn't worry Brouwer who once wrote:
"The construction itself is an art, its application to the world
an evil parasite."

</p><blockquote>Noether was an innovative researcher
who was considered the greatest master of abstract algebra ever;
her advances included a new theory of ideals, the inverse Galois problem,
and the general theory of commutative rings.
She originated novel reasoning methods, especially one based
on "chain conditions," which advanced invariant theory
and abstract algebra; her insistence on generalization led to a unified
theory of modules and Noetherian rings.
Her approaches tended to unify disparate areas (algebra, geometry,
topology, logic) and led eventually to modern category theory.
Her invention of Betti homology groups led to algebraic topology, and thus
revolutionized topology.

<p>Noether's work has found various applications in physics,
and she made direct advances in mathematical physics herself.
Noether's Theorem establishing that certain symmetries imply
conservation laws has been
called the most important Theorem in physics since the Pythagorean Theorem.
Several other important theorems are named after her, e.g.
Noether's Normalization Lemma, which provided an important
new proof of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
Noether was an unusual and inspiring teacher; her successful students
included Emil Artin, Max Deuring, Jacob Levitzki, etc.
She was generous with students and colleagues, even allowing them to claim
her work as their own.
Noether was close friends with the other greatest mathematicians of her
generation: Hilbert, von Neumann, and Weyl.
Weyl once said he was embarrassed to accept the famous Professorship
at G�ttingen because Noether was his "superior as a mathematician."
Emmy Noether is considered the greatest female mathematician ever.

making a major improvement to a famous theorem by Gauss
about lattice points inside a circle.
He went on to do important research in set theory, number theory,
point set topology, the theory of functions, and fractals.
He was extremely prolific, producing 50 books and over 700 papers.
He was a Polish patriot: he contributed to the development of Polish
mathematics despite that his land was controlled by Russians or Nazis for most
of his life.  He worked as a code-breaker during the Polish-Soviet War,
helping to break Soviet ciphers.
Conditionally convergent series are intriguing; Sierpinski proved a stronger
form of the Riemann rearrangement theorem, that such series can be rearranged
to converge to any chosen real value. 
<p>Sierpinski was first to prove Tarski's remarkable conjecture that
the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis implies the Axiom of Choice.
He developed three famous fractals: a space-filling curve;
the Sierpinski gasket; and the Sierpinski carpet, which covers the plane
but has area zero and has found application in antennae design.
Borel had proved that almost all real numbers are "normal" but Sierpinski
was the first to actually display a number which is normal in every base.
He proved the existence of infinitely many Sierpinski numbers having the
property that, e.g. <b>(78557�2<sup>n</sup>+1)</b> is
a composite number for every natural number n.
It remains an unsolved problem (likely to
be defeated soon with high-speed computers) whether 78557
is the smallest such "Sierpinski number."

</p><blockquote>
<p>Weyl studied under Hilbert and became one of the premier
mathematicians and thinkers of the 20th century.
Along with Hilbert and Poincar� he was a great "universal"
mathematician; his discovery of gauge invariance and notion of Riemann
surfaces form the basis of modern physics; he was also
a creative thinker in philosophy.
Weyl excelled at many fields of mathematics including integral equations,
harmonic analysis, analytic number theory, Diophantine approximations,
axiomatic theory, and mathematical philosophy;
but he is most respected for his revolutionary advances
in geometric function theory (e.g., differentiable manifolds),
the theory of compact groups (incl. representation theory), and
theoretical physics (e.g., Weyl tensor, gauge field theory and invariance).
His theorems include key lemmas and foundational results in several fields;
Atiyah commented that whenever
he explored a new topic he found that Weyl had preceded him.
Although he was a master of algebra, he revealed his philosophic
preference by
writing "In these days the angel of topology and the devil of abstract
algebra fight for the soul of every individual discipline of mathematics."
For a while, Weyl was a disciple of Brouwer's Intuitionism and
helped advance that doctrine, but he eventually found it too restrictive.
Weyl was also a very influential figure in all three major fields
of 20th-century physics:
relativity, unified field theory and quantum mechanics.
He and Einstein were great admirers of each other.
Because of his contributions to Schr�dinger, many think the latter's
famous result should be named the Schr�dinger-Weyl Wave Equation.

theory astounds all in the depth of its ideas, its mathematical simplicity,

The tremendous span of his career is suggested by the fact
that he won Smith's Prize (and Senior Wrangler) in 1905
and the Copley Medal in 1958.
He specialized in analysis and analytic number theory
but also did important work in combinatorics, Fourier theory,
Diophantine approximations, differential equations, and other fields.
He also did important work in practical engineering, creating a method
for accurate artillery fire during the First World War,
and developing equations for radio and radar in preparation for the Second War.
He worked with the Prime Number Theorem and Riemann's Hypothesis;
and proved the unexpected fact that Chebyshev's bias, and
<b><i>Li(x)&gt;&#960;(x)</i></b>, while true for most, and all but
very large, numbers, are violated infinitely often.
(Building on this result, it is now known that there is a big
patch of primes near 10<sup>9608</sup> that exceed the Li(x)

most of Littlewood's results were too specialized to state here, e.g.
his widely-applied

<p><a name="Ramanujan" title="Ranked at � #17"><font size="+2"><u>
Srinivasa&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>Ramanujan</b></font> Iyengar</u></font>
(1887-1920) India</a>
</p><blockquote>
Like Abel, Ramanujan was a self-taught prodigy who lived in
a country distant from his mathematical peers, and suffered
from poverty: childhood dysentery and vitamin deficiencies probably led
to his early death.
Yet he produced 4000 theorems or conjectures in number theory,
algebra, and combinatorics.
While some of these were old theorems or just curiosities,
many were brilliant new theorems with very difficult proofs.
For example, he found a beautiful identity connecting
Poisson summation to the M�bius function.
He also found a brilliant generalization of Lagrange's
Four Square Theorem; and a simpler proof of
Chebyshev's Theorem that there is always a prime
between any <i>n</i> and <i>2n</i>;
and much more.
Ramanujan might be almost unknown today, except that
his letter caught the eye of Godfrey Hardy, who saw
remarkable, almost inexplicable formulae which
"must be true, because if they were not true, no one would
have had the imagination to invent them."
Ramanujan's specialties included infinite series,
elliptic functions, continued fractions,
partition enumeration, definite integrals, modular equations,
the divisor function,
gamma functions, "mock theta" functions, hypergeometric series,
and "highly composite" numbers.
Ramanujan's "Master Theorem" has wide application in analysis,
and has been applied to the evaluation of Feynman diagrams.
Much of his best work was done in collaboration with Hardy, for example
a proof that almost all numbers <i>n</i> have about <i>log log n</i>
prime factors (a result which developed into probabilistic number theory).
Much of his methodology, including unusual ideas about divergent series,
was his own invention.
As a young man he made the absurd claim that <b>1+2+3+4+... = -1/12</b>;
his method for this is now called Ramanujan summation.
Later it was noticed that this particular Ramanujan sum corresponds with
the summation Euler had developed to regularize the Riemann zeta function
(with which Ramanujan was unfamiliar).
Ramanujan's innate ability for algebraic manipulations equaled or surpassed
that of Euler and Jacobi.

<p>Ramanujan's most famous work was with the partition enumeration
function <i>p()</i>, Hardy guessing that some of these discoveries would have
been delayed at least a century without Ramanujan.
Together, Hardy and Ramanujan developed an analytic approximation to
<i>p()</i>, although Hardy was initially awed by Ramanujan's intuitive
certainty about the existence of such a formula,
and even the form it would have.
(Rademacher and Selberg later discovered an exact
expression to replace the Hardy-Ramanujan approximation;
when Ramanujan's notebooks were studied it
was found he had anticipated their technique, but had
deferred to his friend and mentor.)

</p><p>In a letter from his deathbed, Ramanujan introduced his mysterious
"mock theta functions",
gave examples, and developed their properties.
Much later these forms began to appear in disparate areas:
combinatorics, the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, and even
knot theory and the theory of black holes.
It was only recently, more than 80 years after Ramanujan's letter,
that his conjectures
about these functions were proven; solutions mathematicians had sought
unsuccessfully were found among his examples.
Mathematicians are baffled that Ramanujan could make these
conjectures, which they confirmed only with difficulty using techniques
not available in Ramanujan's day.

</p><p>Many of Ramanujan's results
are so inspirational that there is a periodical dedicated to them.
The theories of strings and crystals have benefited from Ramanujan's work.
(Today some professors achieve fame just by finding
a new proof for one of Ramanujan's many results.)
Unlike Abel, who insisted on rigorous proofs, Ramanujan
often omitted proofs.
(Ramanujan may have had unrecorded proofs, poverty leading him to
use chalk and erasable slate rather than paper.)
Unlike Abel, much of whose work depended on the complex
numbers, most of Ramanujan's work focused on real numbers.
Despite these limitations, some consider Ramanujan to be the
greatest mathematical genius ever; but he ranks as low as #17
since many lesser mathematicians were much more influential.

</p><p>Because of its fast convergence, an odd-looking formula of Ramanujan is
sometimes used to calculate <b>&#960;</b>:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>99<sup>2</sup> / &#960;
= &#8730;8 &#8721;<sub>k=0,&#8734;</sub>
((4k)! (1103+26390 k) / (k!<sup>4</sup> 396<sup>4k</sup>))</b>

lead to inexplicable infinities.
His most important contribution was to combine relativity and
quantum mechanics by developing, with pure thought, the Dirac Equation.
From this equation, Dirac deduced the existence of anti-electrons,
a prediction considered so bizarre it was ignored --
until anti-electrons were discovered in a cloud chamber four years later.
For this work he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics at age 31,
making him one of the youngest Laureates ever.
Dirac's mathematical formulations, including his Equation and the
Dirac-von Neumann axioms, underpin all of modern particle physics.
After his great discovery, Dirac continued to do important work,

Paradox, his greatest achievements were in formal logic.
He wrote on the definition of truth, developed model theory, and
investigated the completeness questions which also intrigued G�del.
He proved several important systems
to be incomplete, but also established completeness results for
real arithmetic and geometry.
His most famous result may be
Tarski's Undefinability Theorem, which is related to
G�del's Incompleteness Theorem but more powerful.
Several other theorems, theories and paradoxes are named after
Tarski including Tarski-Grothendieck Set Theory,
Tarski's Fixed-Point Theorem of lattice theory (from which
the famous Cantor-Bernstein-Schr�der Theorem is a simple corollary),
and a new derivation of the Axiom of Choice
(which Lebesgue refused to publish because "an implication between two
false propositions is of no interest").
Tarski was first to enunciate the remarkable fact that the
Generalized Continuum Hypothesis implies the Axiom of Choice,
although proof had to wait for Sierpinski.
Tarski's other notable accomplishments include his cylindrical
algebra, ordinal algebra,
universal algebra, and an elegant and novel axiomatic basis of geometry.

John&nbsp; <font color="#a00000"><b>von Neumann</b></font></u></font>
(1903-1957) Hungary, U.S.A.</a>
</p><blockquote>John von Neumann (born Neumann Janos Lajos)
was an amazing childhood prodigy who could do
very complicated mental arithmetic and much more at an early age.
One of his teachers burst into tears at their first meeting,
astonished that such a genius existed.
As an adult he was noted for hedonism and reckless driving
but also became one of the most prolific thinkers in history,
making major contributions in many branches of
both pure and applied mathematics.
He was an essential pioneer of both quantum physics and computer science.

<p>Von Neumann pioneered the use of models in set theory,
thus improving the axiomatic basis of mathematics.
He proved a generalized spectral theorem sometimes called
the most important result in operator theory.
He developed von Neumann Algebras.
He was first to state and prove the Minimax Theorem and
thus invented game theory; this work also advanced operations research;
and led von Neumann to propose the Doctrine of Mutual Assured
Destruction which was a basis for Cold War strategy.
He developed cellular automata (first invented by Stanislaw Ulam),
famously constructing a self-reproducing automaton.
He worked in mathematical foundations: he formulated
the Axiom of Regularity and invented elegant definitions for the
counting numbers (<b>0 = {}</b>, <b>n+1 = n &#8746; {n}</b>).
He also worked in analysis, matrix theory,
measure theory, numerical analysis, ergodic theory
(discovering Birkhoff's Ergodic Theorem before Birkhoff did),
group representations,
continuous geometry, statistics and topology.
Von Neumann discovered an ingenious area-conservation paradox
related to the famous Banach-Tarski volume-conservation paradox.
He inspired some of G�del's famous work
(and independently proved G�del's Second Theorem).
He is credited with (partial) solution to
Hilbert's 5th Problem using the Haar Theorem;
this also relates to quantum physics.
George P�lya once said
"Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of.
If in the course of a lecture I stated an unsolved problem,
the chances were he'd come to me as soon as the lecture was over,
with the complete solution in a few scribbles on a slip of paper."
Michael Atiyah has said he calls only three people geniuses:
Wolfgang Mozart, Srinivasa Ramanujan, and Johnny von Neumann.

</p><p>Von Neumann did very important work in fields other than
pure mathematics.
By treating the universe as a very high-dimensional phase space,
he constructed an elegant mathematical basis
(now called von Neumann algebras)
for the principles of quantum physics.
He advanced philosophical questions about time and
logic in modern physics.
He played key roles in the design of conventional, nuclear and thermonuclear
bombs; he also advanced the theory of hydrodynamics.
He applied game theory and Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem
to economics, becoming a major figure in that field.
His contributions to computer science are many:
in addition to co-inventing the stored-program computer,
he was first to use pseudo-random number generation,
finite element analysis, the merge-sort algorithm,
a "biased coin" algorithm, and (though Ulam first conceived the
approach) Monte Carlo simulation.
By implementing wide-number software he joined several other
great mathematicians (Archimedes, Apollonius, Liu Hui, Hipparchus,
Madhava, and (by proxy), Ramanujan)
in producing the best approximation to <i><b>&#960;</b></i> of his time.
Von Neumann is ranked #94 on <i>Life</i>'s list of the 100 Most
Important people of the past 1000 years.
At the time of his death, von Neumann was working on
a theory of the human brain.

As a youth he dazzled his teachers by constructing
toys that appeared to be "Perpetual Motion Machines."
At the age of 19, he achieved fame by finding a Fourier series
that diverges almost everywhere, and decided to devote
himself to mathematics.
He is considered the founder of the fields of intuitionistic logic,
algorithmic complexity theory,
and (by applying measure theory) modern probability theory.
He also excelled in topology, set theory, trigonometric series,
and random processes.
He and his student Vladimir Arnold proved the surprising
Superposition Theorem, which not only solved Hilbert's 13th Problem, but
went far beyond it.
He and Arnold also developed the "magnificent" Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser
(KAM) Theorem,
which quantifies how strong a perturbation must be to upset
a quasiperiodic dynamical system.
Kolmogorov's axioms of probability are considered a partial solution of
Hilbert's 6th Problem.
He made important contributions to the constructivist ideas
of Kronecker and Brouwer.
While Kolmogorov's work in probability theory had direct
applications to physics, Kolmogorov also did work in physics directly,
especially the study of turbulence.
There are dozens of notions named after Kolmogorov,
such as the Kolmogorov Backward Equation,
the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations,
the Borel-Kolmogorov Paradox,
and the intriguing Zero-One Law of "tail events" among random variables.

</p><blockquote>G�del, who had the nickname <i>Herr Warum</i> ("Mr. Why")
as a child, was perhaps the foremost logic theorist
ever, clarifying the relationships between various modes
of logic.  He partially resolved both Hilbert's 1st and 2nd Problems,
the latter with a proof so remarkable that it was connected to the
drawings of Escher and music of Bach in the title of a famous book.
He was a close friend of Albert Einstein, and was first to discover
"paradoxical" solutions (e.g. time travel) to Einstein's equations.
About his friend, Einstein later said that he had remained at
Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study merely
"to have the privilege of walking home with G�del."
(Like a few of the other greatest 20th-century
mathematicians, G�del was very eccentric.)

<p>Two of the major questions confronting mathematics are:
(1) are its axioms consistent (its theorems all being
true statements)?,
and (2) are its axioms complete (its true statements all being theorems)?
G�del turned his attention to these fundamental questions.
He proved that first-order logic was indeed <i>complete</i>, but that
the more powerful axiom systems needed for arithmetic (constructible
set theory) were necessarily <i>incomplete</i>.
He also proved that the Axioms of Choice (AC) and the Generalized Continuum
Hypothesis (GCH) were <i>consistent</i> with set theory, but that set
theory's own consistency could not be proven.
He may have established that the truths of AC and GCH were <i>independent</i>
of the usual set theory axioms, but the proof was left to Paul Cohen.

</p><p>In G�del's famous proof of Incompleteness,
he exhibits a true statement (<b>G</b>) which
cannot be proven, to wit
"<i><b>G</b> (this statement itself) cannot be proven.</i>"
If <b>G</b> could be proven it would be a contradictory
true statement, so consistency dictates that it indeed <i>cannot</i>
be proven.  But that's what <b>G</b> says, so <b>G</b> is true!
This sounds like mere word play, but building from ordinary logic
and arithmetic G�del was able to construct statement <b>G</b> rigorously.

far-reaching theorems ever, subsuming famous old results (Descartes'
total angular defect, Euler's topological characteristic),
important 19th-century theorems (Gauss-Bonnet, Riemann-Roch),
and incorporating important work by Weil and especially Shiing-Shen Chern.
It is a key to the study of high-dimension
spaces, differential geometry, and equation solving.
Several other key results are named after Atiyah,
e.g. the Atiyah-Bott Fixed-Point Theorem,
the Atiyah-Segal Completion Theorem,
and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.
Atiyah's work developed important connections not only between
topology and analysis, but with modern physics; Atiyah himself was
a key figure in the development of string theory;
and was a proponent of the recent idea that octonions may
underlie particle physics.
He also studied the physics of instantons and monopoles.
This work, and Atiyah-inspired work in gauge theory, restored
a close relationship between leading edge research
in mathematics and physics.
His interest in physics, and an old theory of von Neumann,
led him, as a very old man, to explore the fine structure
constant of physics.
In September 2018 he announced that this
recent work would lead to a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis
but other mathematicians are quite skeptical.
Nonetheless, Michael Atiyah is still regarded as one of the
very greatest mathematicians of the 20th century.
<p>Atiyah was known as a vivacious genius in person, inspiring many,
e.g. Edward Witten.
Atiyah once said a mathematician must sometimes "freely float in the
atmosphere like a poet and imagine the whole universe of possibilities,
and hope that eventually you come down to Earth somewhere else."
He also said "Beauty is an important criterion in mathematics
... It determines what you regard as important and what is not."

<h3>Mathematicians born after 1930</h3>
Many very great mathematicians are alive today.
Although this webpage emphasizes <i>Mathematicians of the Past</i>,
here are mini-bios for a few of the greatest recently-born mathematicians.

<p>&nbsp;
</p><p><a name="Smale" title="Ranked at � #119"><font size="+0"><u>
Stephen&nbsp;
<font color="#a00000"><b>Smale</b></font></u></font>
(1930-) U.S.A.</a>
</p><blockquote>Smale first achieved fame by everting a sphere!
He continued in differential topology, especially higher-dimension manifolds.
He proved the Generalized Poincare Conjecture about N-spheres, for all N &gt; 4,
and generalized this work into the H-Cobordism Theorem.
These proofs used Morse theory, a field he also advanced.
He developed the concept of strange attractors in chaotic dynamical systems;
and then explored the application of dynamical system theory
to fields like economics and electric circuit theory.
Almost 100 years after Hilbert presented his famous unsolved problems for
the 20th century, Smale provided Smale's List of Problems for the 21st century.

<p><a name="Milnor" title="Ranked at � #108"><font size="+0"><u>
John Willard&nbsp;
<font color="#a00000"><b>Milnor</b></font></u></font>
(1931-) U.S.A.</a>
</p><blockquote>Milnor founded the field of differential topology
and has made other major advances in topology,
algebraic geometry and dynamical systems.
He discovered Milnor maps (related to fiber bundles);
important theorems in knot theory;
the Duality Theorem for Reidemeister Torsion;
the Milnor Attractors of dynamical systems;
a new elegant proof of Brouwer's "Hairy Ball" Theorem; and much more.
Some of his earliest work was in game theory where he anticipated Conway's
idea of treating a game as the sum of simpler games.
He is especially famous for two counterexamples which each
revolutionized topology.
His "exotic" 7-dimensional hyperspheres
gave the first examples of homeomorphic manifolds that were not also
diffeomorphic, and developed the fields of
differential topology and <i>surgery theory</i>.
Milnor invented certain high-dimensional polyhedra to disprove the
<i>Hauptvermutung</i> ("main conjecture") of geometric topology.
While most famous for his exotic counterexamples,
his revolutionary insights into dynamical systems have important value to
practical applied mathematics.
Although Milnor has been called the "Wizard of Higher Dimensions,"
his work in dynamics began with novel insights into very
low-dimensional systems.
<p>As Fields, Presidential and (twice) Putnam Medalist, as well as
winner of the Abel, Wolf and <i>two</i> Steele Prizes; Milnor
can be considered the most "decorated" mathematician of the modern era.

<p><a name="Penrose" title="Ranked at � #151 (tie)"><font size="+0"><u>
Roger&nbsp;
<font color="#a00000"><b>Penrose</b></font></u></font>
(1931-) U.K.</a>
</p><blockquote>Roger Penrose is a thinker of great breadth, who has contributed
to biology and philosophy, as well as to mathematics, general relativity and
cosmology.
Some of his earliest work was done in collaboration with his father Lionel,
a polymath and professor of psychiatry who developed the Penrose Square Root Law of
voting theory.
Together, Roger and his father discovered the 'impossible tri-bar' and
an impossible staircase which inspired work by the artist M.C. Escher.
And, in turn, Escher's drawings may have helped inspire Penrose's
most famous discoveries in recreational mathematics: non-periodic tilings.
He soon found such a tiling with just two tile shapes;
the previous record was six shapes.
(Nine years after that, such tilings were observed in nature as "quasi-crystals.")
Penrose has written several successful popular books on science.

<p>As a mathematician, Penrose did important work in algebra: he was first to conceive
of the generalized matrix inverse, and used it for novel solutions in linear
algebra and spectral decomposition.
He did more important work in geometry and topology; for example, he proved
theorems about embedding (or "unknotting") manifolds in Euclidean space.
His best mathematics, e.g. the invention of twistor theory, was inspired
by his pursuit of Einstein's general relativity.

</p><p>Penrose is most noted for his very creative work in cosmology, specifically
in the mathematics of gravitation, space-time, black holes and the Big Bang.
He developed new methods to apply spinors and Riemann tensors to gravitation.
His twistor theory was an effort to relate general relativity
to quantum theory; this work advanced both physics and mathematics.
The top physicist Kip Thorne said "Roger Penrose revolutionized the
mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of space-time."
Stephen Hawking was an early convert to Penrose's methods; the mathematical
laws of black holes (and the Big Bang)
are called the Penrose-Hawking Singularity Theorems.
Penrose formulated the Censorship Hypotheses about black holes, e.g. the Riemannian
Penrose Inequality and the Weyl Curvature Hypothesis;
and discovered Penrose-Terrell rotation.

</p><p>Penrose has proposed <i>conformal cyclic cosmology</i>, that in
the entropy death of one universe, the scaling of time and distance
become arbitrary and the dying universe becomes the big bang for another.
Recently it is proposed
that evidence for this can be seen in the details of
the cosmic microwave background radiation from the early universe.
Many of his theories are extremely controversial:
He claims that G�del's
Incompleteness Theorem provides insight into human consciousness.
He has developed a detailed theory that quantum effects (involving
the microtubules in neurons) enhance the capability of biologic brains.

a 250-page paper, stunned the world of mathematics; it led to
the classification of all finite groups.
Thompson also made major contributions to coding theory,
and to the inverse Galois problem.
His work with Galois groups has been called "the most important
advance since Hilbert's time."

</p><blockquote>Cohen's diverse areas of research included number theory,
trigonometrical series, algebraic geometry, differential equations,
p-adic fields and even the Riemann Hypothesis.
Like Nash, he had a habit of challenging colleagues to present him with
their hardest unsolved problems.
He proved Rudin's conjecture in the field of group algebra;
even more impressive was his proof of Littlewood's famous conjecture
about idempotent measures.

Then he turned his attention to the metamathematical
questions G�del had explored.  In 1963 he established one of the
most exciting results in Logic ever: he proved that both the Axiom of Choice
and the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis were independent of other set
theory axioms.  This solved Hilbert's 1st Problem.
G�del congratulated Cohen by writing "... in all essential respects you
have given the best possible proof and this does not happen frequently.
Reading your proof had a similarly pleasant effect on me as seeing
a really good play."

(1936-) Canada, U.S.A.</a>
</p><blockquote>Langlands discovered a new, unexpected, and very fruitful
link between number theory and harmonic analysis.
Hundreds of mathematicians have devoted their careers to the new methods
and insights which Langlands' work has opened up.
He now sits, as Hermann Weyl Professor, at the Institute for Advanced Study
in the office once occupied by Albert Einstein.
This seems appropriate since, as the man "who reinvented mathematics,"
his advances have sometimes been compared to Einstein's. 
<p>Langlands started by studying semigroups and partial differential
equations but soon switched his attention to representation theory where he
found deep connections between group theory and
automorphic forms; he then used these connections to make profound
discoveries in number theory.
Langlands' methods, collectively called the Langlands Program,
are now central to all of these fields.
The Langlands Dual Group <sup>L</sup>G revolutionized representation theory
and led to a large number of conjectures.
One of these conjectures is the Principle of Functoriality, of which a partial
proof allowed Langlands to prove a famous conjecture of Artin, and Wiles
to prove Fermat's Last Theorem.
Langlands and others have applied these methods to prove several
other old conjectures, and to formulate new more powerful conjectures.
He has also worked with Eisenstein series, L-functions, Lie groups,
percolation theory, etc.
He mentored several important mathematicians (including Thomas Hales,
mentioned briefly in Pappus' mini-bio).
</p><p>Langlands once wrote "Certainly the best times were when I was alone with
mathematics, free of ambition and pretense, and indifferent to the world."

among different branches of mathematics and made contributions to
catastrophe theory, topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry,

</p><blockquote>Conway has done pioneering work in a very broad range
of mathematics including knot theory, number theory, group theory,
lattice theory, combinatorial game theory, geometry, quaternions,
tilings, and cellular automaton theory.
He started his career by proving a case of Waring's Problem,
but achieved fame when he discovered the largest then-known
sporadic group (the symmetry group of the Leech lattice);
this sporadic group is now known to be second in size
only to the <i>Monster Group</i>, with which Conway also worked.
Conway's fertile creativity has produced a
cornucopia of fascinating inventions: markable straight-edge
construction of the regular heptagon (a feat also achieved
by Alhazen, Thabit, Vieta and perhaps Archimedes),
a nowhere-continuous function that has the Intermediate Value property,
the Conway box function,
the rational tangle theorem in knot theory,
the aperiodic pinwheel tiling,
a representation of symmetric polyhedra,
the silly but elegant <i>Fractran</i> programming language,
his chained-arrow notation for large numbers, and many results and
conjectures in recreational mathematics.
The "sliceness" of the Conway Knot was finally resolved in
2018 (paper published 2020) by Lisa Piccirillo.
He found the simplest proof for Morley's Trisector Theorem (sometimes
called the best result in simple plane geometry since ancient Greece).
He proved an unusual theorem about quantum physics:
"If experimenters have free will, then so do elementary particles."
His most famous construction is
the computationally complete automaton
known as the <i>Game of Life</i>.
His most important theoretical invention, however,
may be his <i>surreal numbers</i> incorporating infinitesimals;
he invented them to solve combinatorial games like Go,
but they have pure mathematical significance as the
largest possible ordered field.
<p>Conway's great creativity and breadth
certainly make him one of the greatest living mathematicians.
Conway has won the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics,

He is especially famous for his pseudoholomorphic curves;
they revolutionized the study of symplectic manifolds and are important
in string theory.
By applying his geometric ideas to all areas of mathematics,
Gromov has become one of the most influential living mathematicians.
He has proved a very wide variety of theorems: important results
about groups of polynomial growth, theorems essential to Perelman's proof
of the Poincar� conjecture, the nonsqueezing theorem

Among his earliest important discoveries were results about the
multi-dimensional Kakeya needle problem, which led to advances in
Fourier analysis and fractals.
In addition to his numerous research papers he has written many highly
regarded textbooks.
One of his prize citations commends his "sheer technical power,
his other-worldly ingenuity for hitting upon new ideas,
and a startlingly natural point of view."
<p>Paul Erd�s mentored Tao when he was a ten-year old prodigy,
and the two are frequently compared.  They are both prolific
problem solvers across many fields, though have founded no new fields.
As with Erd�s, much of Tao's work has been done in collaboration:
for example with Van Vu he proved the circular law of random matrices;
with Ben Green he proved the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture and
solved the "orchard-planting problem."
Especially famous is the Green-Tao Theorem that there are arbitrarily long
arithmetic series among the prime numbers (or indeed among any sufficiently
dense subset of the primes).  This confirmed an old
conjecture by Lagrange, and was especially remarkable because the
proof fused methods from number theory, ergodic theory, harmonic analysis,
discrete geometry, and combinatorics.
Tao is also involved in recent efforts to attack the
famous Twin Prime Conjecture.
